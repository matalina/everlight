  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>Nox came back and sat down next to me.  He picked up a peice of bacon and crunched then sipped at the coffee.  &quot;So, I wanted you to know, I've no idea what I'm doing when it comes to dating.  It's not a Venatori thing as you know.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;I guess we are even then.  But you have an advantage in that I'm sure Rider has dated before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm sure Benji has as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think I'm going to talk to Benji about dating a guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it's any different than dating a woman.  I mean it's not like dating is any different between the sexes.&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;So if I came to pick you up with roses and chocolates you'd be okay with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As opposed to what? Bring whiskey and pizza on a date with a guy?&quot; Nox said. &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;  He said scooping a piece of crepe and berry into his mouth.  I was already on my second helping. &quot;I never understood why people like to kill flowers and give them to someone else to watch die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No flowers.  Got it.&quot;  I grinned at him.  &quot;What about jewelry?&quot;</p>
<p>Nox pointed to the bells dangling from his ears.  &quot;I like jewelry. What about you? flowers, chocolate and jewelry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose I could do all of it.  But I won't make you buy me flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>He put his elbow on the counter and put his chin on his hand and batted his long eyelashes.  &quot;I'd buy you flowers if you'd like them, maybe a bonsai tree or a succulent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I have to water it, it's gonna die, so let's not do anything you want me to keep alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox grinned at me, &quot;How about I just cook for you, bring the ingredients and you eat it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No honey.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No fish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we are golden.&quot; I grinned at him.</p>
<p>We're were seriously gonna do this thing.  We were going to date. &quot;So this isn't a date?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. It wasn't out of the house. It's not asked. A date is asked, out of the house, and dropped off.  Until the third then there might be a spending the night.&quot; Nox winked.</p>
<p>&quot;So this Wednesday will be number one?&quot; I asked a little disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I can't pick you up though. I did the asking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was more like telling. But it counts. And I will drive. I'm not sure I want a New Yorker driving me around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can drive.&quot; Nox laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the city. This is hardly New York.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True.&quot; He agreed. &quot;And I already know what we are n going to do. But I need to make sure it's possible still so I can't tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like surprises.&quot; Nox said with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's good to know.&quot; Nox nodded like he was making a mental note.  &quot;I don't like secrets or lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I gathered that.&quot; I grabbed knocking my shoulder into his. &quot;I will do my best. Lying is sorry the stick of trade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mine too. Just not in my personal life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Understood. I will do my best, I promise.&quot;  I would likely fail. &quot;But I might fall spectacularly.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox grinned at me.&quot;I'll try to keep an open mind about the reason. I'm a bit rigid in some things. A lot of things. So we'll both try, together.&quot;</p>
<p>For some reason that last word resonated with me.  His smile, I just wanted to kiss those lips.  I leaned in but a throat cleared behind me.</p>
<p>&quot;No fucking in my kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;There will be no fucking for a while if you must know.&quot;  He winked at me and Benji blushed.</p>
<p>&quot;Fucking Venatori.&quot;  He said.  The rounded the island we were sitting and made a second plate. &quot;You better keep this one, even if he can't make anything else.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those are mine.&quot; I growled.</p>
<p>&quot;It's my house.&quot; Benji countered.</p>
<p>Nox shifted his shoulder into mine and leaned his head against it batting his eye lashes up at me, &quot;I can make you more anytime. Just let me stock the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned at him.  &quot;Why don't you just move everything in, and run my kitchen completely.  It's a win-win for everyone.  I get home cooked meals, and you get the fuck away from the murderous bastards who are trying to kill you.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox shrugged. &quot;That'll die down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not here it won't&quot;  Benji said with me only a step behind.  I continued, &quot;They'll fuck with you till you leave or till you die.  Either way they don't care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everlight is a very different city.  If the Venatori don't kill you someone else will.  You're an easy target if the Venatori don't protect you.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;I don't need Venatori protection.  I've never had it.  Never needed it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's kinda gotta point.&quot; I agreed. &quot;He's already playing nice with the local vamps.  Got an in with the childe of the Hound.  Knows some secrets.  I bet he could make nice with Il Cane and easily have run of the town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even Salvatore Einor steps wide of Il Cane.&quot; Benji nodded. &quot;He should do both.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you need to get your brother the fuck outta there too.  He's even more defenseless.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox shook his head. &quot;Rider can handle himself.&quot;  But he sighed. &quot;You aren't going to let it go are you?&quot;</p>
<p>We both shook our head. &quot;Fine.  Take me home, we can drop Rider off at the Coven and you can bring me here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There ain't no room in Serenity for three.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>Benji grinned. &quot;He cooks me dinner tonight, and you can borrow the sedan.&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. &quot;Fine.&quot;  I looked to Nox and he shrugged. &quot;That's cool with me, But Alex will have to take me shopping.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't you just leave me a list and I'll round out what we need here and buy you whatever groceries you need for Alex's.  Sound good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose.&quot;  He said.  Nox didn't look thrilled with the idea, but he went with it.  I'd have balked a lot more.  But there was something in the way he deferred that made me concerned a bit.</p>
<p>He grinned at me. &quot;I'm not <em>that</em> submissive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How...&quot;  I shook my head. &quot;I don't wanna know.  But it's good to know.&quot;</p>
