<p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>Nox came back and sat down next to me.  He picked up a peice of bacon and crunched then sipped at the coffee.  &quot;So, I wanted you to know, I've no idea what I'm doing when it comes to dating.  It's not a Venatori thing as you know.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;I guess we are even then.  But you have an advantage in that I'm sure Rider has dated before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm sure Benji has as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think I'm going to talk to Benji about dating a guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it's any different than dating a woman.  I mean it's not like dating is any different between the sexes.&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;So if I came to pick you up with roses and chocolates you'd be okay with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As opposed to what? Bring whiskey and pizza on a date with a guy?&quot; Nox said. &quot;I like chocolate.&quot;  He said scooping a piece of crepe and berry into his mouth.  I was already on my second helping. &quot;I never understood why people like to kill flowers and give them to someone else to watch die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No flowers.  Got it.&quot;  I grinned at him.  &quot;What about jewelry?&quot;</p>
<p>Nox pointed to the bells dangling from his ears.  &quot;I like jewelry. What about you? flowers, chocolate and jewelry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose I could do all of it.  But I won't make you buy me flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>He put his elbow on the counter and put his chin on his hand and batted his long eyelashes.  &quot;I'd buy you flowers if you'd like them, maybe a bonsai tree or a succulent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I have to water it, it's gonna die, so let's not do anything you want me to keep alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox grinned at me, &quot;How about I just cook for you, bring the ingredients and you eat it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No honey.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No fish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we are golden.&quot; I grinned at him.</p>
<p>We're were seriously gonna do this thing.  We were going to date. &quot;So this isn't a date?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. It wasn't out of the house. It's not asked. A date is asked, out of the house, and dropped off.  Until the third then there might be a spending the night.&quot; Nox winked.</p>
<p>&quot;So this Wednesday will be number one?&quot; I asked a little disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I can't pick you up though. I did the asking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was more like telling. But it counts. And I will drive. I'm not sure I want a New Yorker driving me around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can drive.&quot; Nox laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the city. This is hardly New York.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True.&quot; He agreed. &quot;And I already know what we are n going to do. But I need to make sure it's possible still so I can't tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like surprises.&quot; Nox said with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's good to know.&quot; Nox nodded like he was making a mental note.  &quot;I don't like secrets or lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I gathered that.&quot; I grabbed knocking my shoulder into his. &quot;I will do my best. Lying is sorry the stick of trade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mine too. Just not in my personal life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Understood. I will do my best, I promise.&quot;  I would likely fail. &quot;But I might fall spectacularly.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox grinned at me.&quot;I'll try to keep an open mind about the reason. I'm a bit rigid in some things. A lot of things. So we'll both try, together.&quot;</p>
<p>For some reason that last word</p>
