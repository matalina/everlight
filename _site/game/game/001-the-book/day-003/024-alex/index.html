  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn't expect a fight, much less a fucking werewolf.  A fucking werewolf -- his brother turned into a fucking werewolf!</p>
<p>I activated the fearless rune and pulled the gun from my boot -- I never left home without a little protection but Jesus fucking Crist I didn't expect to find a need for it.</p>
<p>Nothing but weird shit happened since meeting Nox.  Maybe this wasn't worth this, but as I stood there after the mass confusion going through my head with a werewolf sitting next to me nuzzling Nox I couldn't help but smile at the man before me.  He fucking radiated something -- I didn't know what.  It wasn't lust.  Wasn't exactly love -- safety, kindness.  I just wanted to be around him.</p>
<p>Fuck me! I was gone.</p>
<p>He smiled at me as he drew on his shirt with a little bit of fire to go with the blood and holes already in it.  He was so throwing that away when we got home.  And then he was gone with little more than a go wait for me and I'll find you.</p>
<p>I looked at the wolf sitting looking up at me with what I could only call a shit eating grin. &quot;What?&quot; I asked.  I rolled my eyes and I headed to the car and let Rider hope in back.  &quot;You fuck the seats up you are paying for them.  Benji can get pissed off at you.  Got it?&quot;</p>
<p>The wolf whimpered and curled up on the back seat and closed his eyes.  Obviously he didn't mind being a wolf.  I'd be freaking the fuck out -- or would I?  would I even know I was a wolf.  Weren't they supposed to freak the fuck out?  Go mad and eat people?  He seemed content.</p>
<p>I drove to where Nox said to met him and I waited.  Fuck!  There was a werewolf in Benji's car.  The wolf nudge my elbow and I turned to look at him. &quot;Don't give me those puppy dog eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>He whimpered and I relented patting him on the head then scratching him behind the ears.  &quot;Why the fuck are you so calm?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Premonition (eased) (12)</em><br>
(1d20: [15] = 15)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: None<br>
(1d20: [5] = 5)</p>
<hr>
<p>As I said the words I opened myself to Rider and looked for that one thing that might answer my question.  When I opened my eyes I laughed.  &quot;Nox fucking Sétanta.  Of course it had to be your brother.  If he didn't do what he did before you'd be raging out your mind with new wolf brains.  Just hope it lasts.  I'm pretty sure I can't fight off a werewolf.&quot;</p>
<p>Rider whimpered again and shoved his head under my hand again.  This time I relaxed into a soft petting like I might a cute dog.  It was unexpected, but we both seemed soothed by the idea so I went with it.  We'd wait for Nox here until he showed up -- in the silent company of man and his pet werewolf!</p>
<p>I don't know how long we waited.  Several songs on the radio played.  Several commercials too.  I was fiddling with my phone when the door opened to the back seat and bags tumbled in scaring Rider.  He was on all fours, hackles raised when Nox noticed and shook his hand from the sparks that had flown as he deactivated the rune.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.  I forgot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You get everything?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Nox nodded as he hopped in the front seat next to me. &quot;I did.  I don't think we should take Rider to the coven looking like that you mind?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked back at the wolf now circling the back seat making a space for his new bedding. &quot;Yeah I think we can manage to get him some food and if we have to someone to shift him back to normal.  I don't know how the fuck this works.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;Me either.  Not really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's your fault you know.&quot;  I said as I pulled out into the street and away from the Venatori compound forever -- I hoped anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;How is that?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;That fucking magic of yours.&quot;  I laughed, &quot;Rider agrees, well it was his thought.&quot;</p>
