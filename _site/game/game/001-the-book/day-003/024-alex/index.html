<hr>
<p>I didn't expect a fight, much less a fucking werewolf.  A fucking werewolf -- his brother turned into a fucking werewolf!</p>
<p>I activated the fearless rune and pulled the gun from my boot -- I never left home without a little protection but Jesus fucking Crist I didn't expect to find a need for it.</p>
<p>Nothing but weird shit happened since meeting Nox.  Maybe this wasn't worth this, but as I stood there after the mass confusion going through my head with a werewolf sitting next to me nuzzling Nox I couldn't help but smile at the man before me.  He fucking radiated something -- I didn't know what.  It wasn't lust.  Wasn't exactly love -- safety, kindness.  I just wanted to be around him.</p>
<p>Fuck me! I was gone.</p>
<p>He smiled at me as he drew on his shirt with a little bit of fire to go with the blood and holes already in it.  He was so throwing that away when we got home.  And then he was gone with little more than a go wait for me and I'll find you.</p>
<p>I looked at the wolf sitting looking up at me with what I could only call a shit eating grin. &quot;What?&quot; I asked.  I rolled my eyes and I headed to the car and let Rider hope in back.  &quot;You fuck the seats up you are paying for them.  Benji can get pissed off at you.  Got it?&quot;</p>
<p>The wolf whimpered and curled up on the back seat and closed his eyes.  Obviously he didn't mind being a wolf.  I'd be freaking the fuck out -- or would I?  would I even know I was a wolf.  Weren't they supposed to freak the fuck out?  Go mad and eat people?  He seemed content.</p>
<p>I drove to where Nox said to met him and I waited.  Fuck!  There was a werewolf in Benji's car.  The wolf nudge my elbow and I turned to look at him. &quot;Don't give me those puppy dog eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>He whimpered and I relented patting him on the head then scratching him behind the ears.  &quot;Why the fuck are you so calm?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Premonition (eased) (12)</em><br>
(1d20: [15] = 15)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: None<br>
(1d20: [5] = 5)</p>
<hr>
<p>As I said the words I opened myself to Rider and looked for that one thing that might answer my question.  When I opened my eyes I laughed.  &quot;Nox fucking Sétanta.  Of course it had to be your brother.  If he didn't do what he did before you'd be raging out your mind with new wolf brains.  Just hope it lasts.  I'm pretty sure I can't fight off a werewolf.&quot;</p>
<p>Rider whimpered again and shoved his head under my hand again.  This time I relaxed into a soft petting like I might a cute dog.  It was unexpected, but we both seemed soothed by the idea so I went with it.  We'd wait for Nox here until he showed up -- in the silent company of man and his pet werewolf!</p>
<p>I don't know how long we waited.  Several songs on the radio played.  Several commercials too.  I was fiddling with my phone when the door opened to the back seat and bags tumbled in scaring Rider.  He was on all fours, hackles raised when Nox noticed and shook his hand from the sparks that had flown as he deactivated the rune.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.  I forgot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You get everything?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Nox nodded as he hopped in the front seat next to me. &quot;I did.  I don't think we should take Rider to the coven looking like that you mind?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked back at the wolf now circling the back seat making a space for his new bedding. &quot;Yeah I think we can manage to get him some food and if we have to someone to shift him back to normal.  I don't know how the fuck this works.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;Me either.  Not really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's your fault you know.&quot;  I said as I pulled out into the street and away from the Venatori compound forever -- I hoped anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;How is that?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;That fucking magic of yours.&quot;  I laughed, &quot;Rider agrees, well it was his thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox shrugged.  &quot;I guess.  It does do weird shit.  But I've no control over pack magic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think it matters.&quot; I spoke for Rider too, though I was just making an assumption.  I really had no clue.  Nothing to say one way or the other.  Hell I didn't even know what the fuck happened.  Why did the Venatori hate him so much?  Maybe that was a factor his fucking magic too.  That aura about him.  Maybe it's why I was drawn to him.</p>
<p>I drove lost in thought.  It wasn't like I knew this city well, but it wasn't hard to get from the compound home -- it wasn't far at all.</p>
<p>The busy streets gave way to the trees of the Nightstalker Forest and then into the lands around the Wei mansion.  I wasn't sure how much of it was pack land around here, but Rider's wolf form shivered as we entered the forest.  He didn't whimper, but he was sitting up, looking out the window with his nose pressed against the glass.  I almost let the window down, except I was afraid he might jump out of the car and I wasn't ready to chase down a werewolf into the middle of werewolf territory.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel the magic all around us.  The Pack's going to be finding us soon.  We should warn your friend.&quot; Nox said.</p>

<hr>
<p>The door to Benji's house was wide open.  Nox was out of the door before the engine even shut off.  He drew a gun that I hadn't even known he'd had.  Maybe he picked it up when he got his things?  I thought to myself.  But honestly he could have had it on him the whole time with his magic and all that.</p>
<p>He quickly made it to the front door and was pushing it open scanning the room from the doorway like he'd done it a thousand times before.  Maybe he had.</p>

<hr>
<p>I climbed out of the car slowly, Rider seemed to have the same caution I did.  I should call the cops or something?  But Nox had said he felt magic all around.  I looked to the wolf walking beside me. &quot;Do you feel what he does?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does rider feel what Nox does?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [12]+0 = 12)<br>

<hr>
<p>The wolf shook but I didn't know what that meant.  Though his golden eyes searched the area around us and I think I got it.  He felt something, but didn't know what it was.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what Nox saw, but he was already walking in through the room.  His gun pointed towards the door and he almost disappeared into the shadows when when Rider and I reached the door.  He looked around every corner and in every nook of the entry spaces.  Up the stairs, down the hall.  But he kept going in one steady direction towards the back of the house.</p>

<hr>
<p>I followed the pretty boy through Benji's house as he cleared each room before we found anything amiss in the kitchen.  A man of oriental descent sat on a stool we'd previously had breakfast on sipping a cup of tea.  The whisps of steam curling up and around his face fogging up his glasses.</p>
<p>He didn't look like much, thin and frail, yet there was strength in the way he sat.  Rider's fur at the nape of his neck stood on end, his teeth bared yet he made no sound.  Nox's gun was aimed in the man's general direction, but it was dipped down so he wasn't aiming at him directly.</p>
<p>The dark gaze of the man took us in and he disregarded everyone but Rider.  He slid lithely from the stool and approached Rider with his head cocked to the side. &quot;Now why didn't I feel you before?&quot;</p>
<p>Rider growled as the man approached.</p>
<p>&quot;He's new in town, followed me here.  He didn't know he was a wolf.  We didn't know.&quot; Nox said.</p>
<p>The man turned to look at Nox with a frown.  &quot;Yet he changes without the moon.  And I can't exert my power over him.&quot;  He turned back to Rider and knelt down in front of him.   &quot;You are Venatori, he is not.  Why is he here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's my twin brother.&quot; Nox said flatly.  &quot;He followed me here when I got exiled.&quot;</p>
<p>The man stood up and approached Nox.  His muscles tensed but he didn't train his gun higher.  He just stared defiantly at the man approaching.  The man reached out his hand and I was afraid that something bad was about to happen but the man took three steps back and looked from Nox to Rider then back again before he returned to his stool and his tea.  &quot;We've been tracking a thief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A thief?&quot; I asked.  &quot;What did you do with Benji?&quot; I growled.</p>
<p>The man laughed. &quot;I did nothing to your friend.  Our friend.  I tracked the thief here and sent my trackers after him.  I stayed to tell you.  I didn't know you were harboring strangers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>The man looked shocked and then dusted off his hands after setting down his cup of tea.  &quot;I apologize.  My name is Gregory Lin.  I'm Alpha of the Nightstalker Pack.  Your friend Benjamin Wei and I have an understanding. He and his reside on pack lands in exchange for assistance when required.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How does Benji help you?  He's not...&quot;  I was going to say magical, but then Benji and I had been friends in Vegas for strange reasons.  Reasons I was forgetting at the moment, they slipped through my fingers when I tried to reach them.</p>
<p>Gregory Lin chuckled. &quot;It is often hard to remember aspects of our own deals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is he?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Lin shrugged. &quot;It is not for us to know yet.  Just that he is a friend.  A mutual friend we must save.  Again my trackers are following his kidnappers.  Do you know what they might be after.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox and I both said at the same time. &quot;The Book.&quot;</p>
