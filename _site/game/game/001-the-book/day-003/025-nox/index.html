<p>Alpha of the pack in Alex's kitchen wasn't surprising, it was Alex's response that caught me off guard.  I looked at him, &quot;Why would anyone be after Benji because of the book?  Is that what you guys were doing at the club when we met?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex shrugged. &quot;You think we were there picking up girls?&quot; Alex asked with a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>I hadn't really given it any thought.  Why was he there?  &quot;So you agreed to help me so you could take it from me?&quot;  I blurted out before I really thought about what I was saying.</p>
<p>The look on Alex's face said yes, but he didn't say anything.  There was guilt but also something else.</p>
<p>&quot;What's this book?&quot; Lin asked sipping at his tea like this was his place.</p>
<p>&quot;Bowers asked me to steal it.  Some book of prophecy that the vampires want.  Honestly he didn't really enlighten me too much. He's got an old journal with the Book's last known whereabouts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The book is supposed to be full of forbidden magics.  Powerful and anyone who gets their hands on it could be a god.&quot; Alex added.  He looked at me with a smug look.  He knew stuff too it said.</p>
<p>&quot;And why did you want it?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Alex smirked. &quot;Because it's locked in a vault and someone else wants it.  So naturally I have to have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who else wants it?&quot; Lin asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Benji and I overheard some vampires talking about it the other night.&quot;  Alex said with a confused look on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Pack magic.&quot; I said nodding towards Lin.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not part of his pack.&quot;  Alex growled.</p>
<p>&quot;The house is on pack land.&quot; I shrugged. &quot;He has power here.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex just growled.</p>
<p>&quot;You are exiled from your home.  You come to mine and start trouble.  And now two fucking Feras are on pack lands with another pack's alpha and my friend is taken.  You will help me get him back or the price you pay will be your deaths.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait.  Wait. Wait!&quot; Alex growled and he was pulling for his won gun.</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay, Alex&quot;  I said with a smile.  &quot;There is no need for anyone to threaten anyone else.  We didn't come here to start trouble.  I was sent her by my people because they want to get rid of me.  And I'm thinking after what happened outside the compound, I'm on a kill list.  So the Venatori want me dead.  Alex I can't imagine you are free of that now either.  I don't expect your mother will be happy.  We need to get Benji.  There is no need to threaten us.  At least not me.  Rider doesn't know anything about what just happened.  He's trained Sussuri they aren't a pack.  He has no pack.  He can't be alpha of anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet he is.&quot; Lin nodded. &quot;He could likely shift back now if he so desired.  I feel his power.  You do too.  I know you do, I feel yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's not a wolf.&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;If his twin brother is a wolf, then he's a wolf.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at me taking a step back out of fear, and I dropped my gaze to the floor.  Yeah that's what we needed.</p>
<p>Alex closed the distance and put his finger under my chin.  &quot;That's not what I meant to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay.&quot; I said pulling a way from his grasp and looked at Lin.  &quot;Get me in contact with your trackers.  I'll get Benji back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll help.&quot;  Alex said stoutly.</p>
<p>Lin just smiled.  &quot;I will help your brother.  He's a bit to learn if this is indeed his first transition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is.&quot; I said.  &quot;Apparently he only changed because of me, the chaos around me.&quot;</p>
<p>Lin peered over his cup of tea with squinted eyes.  &quot;Perhaps, or perhaps he has just been waiting for the right moment.  The moon is full tonight.  Not typical to turn before the night falls, but it's been known to happen.  Perhaps both.  The full moon does bring a rise in all magics.&quot; Lin lectured.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is there anything special about the moon tonight?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [12]+0 = 12)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Proof, Lake, Sister<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Tonight's is particularly powerful. Your Sussuri trained friend should know of it.&quot; Lin continued but he slid from the stool land looked at the three of us.  &quot;Soror Lacus moon.  Tides will be at an unusually high peak with her watching over us.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at me like I was supposed to know.  &quot;A Sussuri lore, I know as much as you do.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Lin shrugged. &quot;I don't know.  I'll take your brother. Well talk. I'll text Alex my tracker's info, since I have that and you guys do what ever you do. And if my guys die I got a hostage.&quot;</p>
<p>Rider growled.</p>
<p>I put my hand on his head and just. &quot;It's okay. I got this.&quot; I looked to Alex, &quot;We got this.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded. &quot;I'll do anything to help Benji.&quot;</p>
<p>Lin stroud across the distance and put his hand on Rider's wolf head and smiled. &quot;He is a powerful one  Come on, new one. Well get you sorted.&quot;</p>
<p>Rider whimpered but he followed with a glance back at me.  &quot;I'll come get you. Don't worry.&quot; I tried to restore my brother, but I don't know how effective I was.</p>
<p>We watched them lop off into the trees of the Nightstalker Forest the surrounded the mansion.  &quot;This is all my fault.&quot; Alex growled.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not.  You didn't kidnap him. He got involved. No one is too blame. But we will fix it.&quot; I said. &quot;You got that contact info?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded and flipped through a few screens and my phone went off with a ping from Alex. &quot;You're the hunter. I'll follow you.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>I scanned the information Alex sent me.  Nothing really more than a phone number and some initials. &quot;You know them?&quot; I asked Alex.</p>
<p>&quot;Never meets any of the wolves here. Haven't been here that long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright.  Here we go.&quot; I said as I punched in the number.</p>
<p>Three phone rang for a few beats and then a gruff voice answered. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gregory Lin have me your number. You are tracking Benji's kidnapers.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>There was silence followed by rustling sounds.  There's were no words, but I got the distinct feeling that there was a conversation going on in the other side. Telephathic or something else entirely, but a conversation nonetheless.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I'll ping you the coordinates we are at. Don't call again.&quot; He said briefly and then hung up.</p>
<p>My phone pinged with a notification. &quot;Well that went well. We have a location.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Alex know the place?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [10]+0 = 10)<br>
<strong>Maybe</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is it still in the forest?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [11]+0 = 11)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Ruler, Smoke, Gift</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are they near sal?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [3]+0 = 3)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> The catacombs?</em><br>

(1d20+0: [20]+0 = 20)<br>
<strong>Yes, and</strong> Pattern, Music, Duty<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Was this a trap by the pack?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [14]+0 = 14)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is Lin in on the trap?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [17]+0 = 17)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are the trackers?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [8]+0 = 8)<br>
<strong>No, but</strong> Love, Turgid, Champion</p>
