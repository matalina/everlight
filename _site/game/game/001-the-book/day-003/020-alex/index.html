<p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  UnstableÂ 4Â (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>Waking to the washer buzzing was new.  Fucking bolted upright in a panic, forgetting I had a pretty boy staying the night.  I saw the bathroom door closed and it slowly dawned on me and then he opened the door with just a towel on.  He was fucking hot in his boxers, but there is something about a guy having just been wet and wearing just a towel.  I was surprised I could talk.</p>
<p>I sorta followed him out of the room.  But I donned a pair of sweat pants and pulled a t-shirt over my head while I followed.  He was fucking amazing and his skin so perfect, nary a hair on his body that shouldn't be.  He either waxed or was blessed.  But I would nearly bet he waxed even if it was light colored.  He seemed the twinkish kid growing up.  Definitely wasn't one now.</p>
<p>He had scathing comments for my choice of food.  But it was in jest -- mostly.  And while I wanted him alone, maybe having Benji around would be good so I fetched him some clothes to wear.  The fucking thought of him changing in my bathroom and putting on makeup in my clothes had me all a bother.  Fucking hell!  How was I so far gone?  How the fuck was I going to date him, much less make it three real dates before having sex?  What the fuck did you do on a date?</p>
<p>When he came out in a pair of my slightly too short sweat pants, his legs were longer than mine, or he pushed them up to reveal a little more ankle that I did.  He pulled on his chucks and quickly took them back off with an eww face.  &quot;Yeah, no.&quot;  He said. &quot;Is it dangerous walk?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Your tender feet will be fine on the walk across the lawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.  Shoes without socks I can't do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can borrow some.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd take my shoes off once I got there anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>I couldn't help but grin that he was making himself at home.  &quot;Ready?&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;As rain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No bells on?&quot;</p>
<p>He chuckled and walked around to where he'd slept and slipped the cuffs back on his ears.  &quot;I can.&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes and offered him my arm to walk across the lawn to watch him make me breakfast from scratch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong>Â Is Benji up?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [18]+0 = 18)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>We walked into the back door which was the kitchen entry.  Nox stopped at the threshold.  &quot;Are you sure I can cook in here?&quot; He leaned over, &quot;Doesn't look like anyone uses it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Benji doesn't.  The chef might, but I think he usually brings it in as catering type deal. But yes, it's a kitchen it's meant to be cooked in.&quot;</p>
<p>I waved my hands, &quot;Have at it.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a pretty grand kitchen.  The whole house was opulant and extravagent.  I didn't like it myself.  Nox started opening cupboards and pulling out items he needed.  He found flour and baking powder and other things I didn't know what they were.  Bowls and spoons.  The fridge was well stocked even though Benji didn't use any of it really.  He even found bacon which I smiled at.  Who doesn't love bacon.</p>
<p>He found a thing I had no idea what it was and filled it with water and coffee and started making coffee on the stove.  He looked at me with a grin.  &quot;It's a french press.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded like I understood.  I sat at the bar watching him but got up and pulled his phone from the pocket of the sweat pants.  &quot;Music.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>His smile brightened and he unlocked his phone and I started flipping through his playlists and found one that had mostly dance songs on it and hooked it up to Benji's sound system before pressing play.</p>
<p>Nox laughed loudly but that was his only reaction as he was now dancing and mouthing the words as he cooked me breakfast.</p>
<p>I stole a glance at the contacts in his phone and found only a handful.  Most of them were appended with Work meaning they weren't actually friends.  Besides my name, there was only Rider.  I tapped on his brothers message and found a string of early morning texts between the brothers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rider:</strong> Missed ya last night. Sleep well bro?<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> Woke up like shit but yeah<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> This bed fucking sucks<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> Sorry<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> Going to see Leila today.  Have to check in.  Lunch?<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> Can I get back with ya?  Hot boy in bed.<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> ðŸ™‰<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> Shouldn't that be see no evil?<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> No I don't wanna hear about it<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> Nothing happened - except argument #2<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> Did you flare?<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> No. Need to do the thing...<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> ðŸ™„ Yoga, run, shower, eat... predictable  Remember I want Lunch!<br>
<strong>Nox:</strong> I'll let ya know.  Luv ya ðŸ§¡<br>
<strong>Rider:</strong> ðŸ§¡</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I looked up Nox was watching me while he stirred the batter. &quot;Enjoy?&quot;</p>
<p>I blushed. He didn't look mad though, I knew people who would be pissed.  He seemed amused. &quot;Who's Leila?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's the coven leader here.  Rider has to check in with the coven so they don't oust him from the city.  They don't like outsiders in their territory anymore than Venatori, Packs or the Kisses do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that.  I didn't know he was Sussuri.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Raised by them, he can practice to a small degree.  But more like a Venatori - he can't draw runes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not many people can do that.  The ink is rare.&quot; I nodded with understanding. &quot;My dad is a roaming shaman.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes went wide.  &quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned, &quot;Yeah.  I like surprising you.  Mr. Know-It-All.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled and turned his attentions back to his fixings of my crepes and compote.</p>
<p>&quot;What did Rider mean when he said flare?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes when I get angry or upset I pop off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds so naughty.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;That's why I keep saying it to you.  I usually say flare.  My anger management as a kid was horrible, I pissed off a lot of people.  Took a few years of therapy to get a regime in place to manage it so I could control the flare ups.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn't you just get the rune?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And lock up all the potential?  When it can be handled with knowledge and understanding?  Venatori want it easy, they are closed minded.  They don't think outside the box.  I imagine that's why you left.  Our half human side opening a door they couldn't never imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>I hadn't really thought about it like that.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't imagine not having an on and off switch though.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox grinned at me and traced the circle with a line through it on his left hand with a finger.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong>Â Nox draws and activates a rune(9)</em><br>
(1d20: [19] = 19)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
<strong>Minor effect or Damage +3</strong><br>
Developer:Â <strong>But...</strong><br>
Obligation, Tunnel, Express<br>
(1d20: [8] = 8)</p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura:</em> (1d20: [3] = 3)  -&gt; Random Fire Ignites Nearby</p>
<hr>
<p>There was a flash of fire nearby in the pan he was heating up and he closed his eyes and he paled.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you just draw a rune without ink and it worked?&quot;</p>
<p>He grinned though he looked like he was going to puke.  He held up his hand and asked me to wait a minute.  Nox traced the rune again.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong>Â Deactivate runeÂ (6)</em><br>
(1d20: [12] = 12)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: None<br>
(1d20: [18] = 18)</p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura:</em> (1d20: [2] = 2)  -&gt; all actions are hindered for one minute</p>
<hr>
<p>The scent of rain on hot asphalt permeated the air for a moment before fading dream.  He looked better. &quot;Yes.  It's nauseating at first and it's not worth the downtime to contain it. I need it do what I do.&quot;  Nox admitted.  &quot;I don't hear voices or see things, it's just random magic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just magic.&quot; I laughed.</p>
