  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>I left Benji a list and Alex grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out of his friends abode back to where his car was parked.  &quot;Though you living with me does pose one problem.&quot; Alex said as he opened my door for me.</p>
<p>I grinned.  &quot;You mean the whole pick up drop off no sex till the third date thing?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded.  &quot;We'll have to define some rules.  And uh, I only have one bed.&quot;</p>
<p>I bit my bottom lip as I leaned over to unlock his door and he slid in next to me. &quot;Maybe we'll just have to be good.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at me as I stretched what I could as I readjusted in the seat. He rolled his eyes. &quot;I don't think you know how to behave yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; I said innocently.  Though I could behave.  I did it all the time.  I just liked knowing he was looking, watching, and found me attractive.  And not in the I want to own you, fuck you and leave you type of attraction that most Venatori looked at me like. &quot;I can be good.  I just like the way you look at me.&quot; I confessed.</p>
<p>Alex smirked. &quot;I like looking at you.  We won't make it to a first date you keep moving like that.  Dressing like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These are your clothes.&quot; I complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.  Do you know how fucking hot it is having you naked in my clothes?&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;Naked in your clothes?  Isn't that...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll behave.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pouted. &quot;And if I don't want you to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now who is teasing who?&quot;  I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Only fair?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned. &quot;I suppose.  Let's go get my things.  Take Rider to the coven and we can talk all about how this is going to work.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything happen on their ride to the Venatori compound?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [3]+0 = 3)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> anything happen once they get there?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [13]+0 = 13)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are there people trying to hurt Rider?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [13]+0 = 13)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>

(1d20+0: [6]+0 = 6)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is Rider giving off Therian vibes?</em><br>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did Rider shift?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [2]+0 = 2)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Blood, Bell, Noxious</p>
<hr>
<p>We didn't really find a solution to our issue but we pulled up to the bunk house.  It should have been quiet entrance but it wasn't -- a shouting crowd was not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>&quot;That don't look good.&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;If I said, stay here you wouldn't listen would you?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a chance, lover.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;That's what I thought, so I won't say it.  Be careful and don't stand too close.&quot; I warned.</p>
<p>He looked at me strange. &quot;Oh.  Right?&quot; He put his hands together and separated them violently. &quot;Boom!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex turned off the car and we got out.  I didn't wait for him to open the door and Alex hung back a little as I walked up the stairs to the crowd in front of the door.  I heard my twins voice loud and clear.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Damien and I will not put up with your fucking shit.&quot;  He growled -- an actual growl, a low rumble in his throat that grew louder.</p>
<p>Rider's voice carried, the growl rumbled deep in my chest.  Alex grabbed my elbow to keep me from the power he and all the other Venatori felt rippling from my brother.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be okay.&quot;  I said walking up to my brother with a calm smile.  The other Venatori looked at the two of us like they were seeing double.  I gave them a smirk. &quot;Didn't know I had a brother did you?&quot;</p>

Nearby Shadows Seem to Dance and Flicker</p>
<hr>
<p>Flowers bloomed below us as I put my hand on Rider's shoulder and started to trace a rune on his shirt.  His power subsided and the shadows nearby from the building and trees seemed to dance and flicker in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The Venatori looked at us, raised their preverbal pitchforks and rushed us.</p>
