  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>I left Benji a list and Alex grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out of his friends abode back to where his car was parked.  &quot;Though you living with me does pose one problem.&quot; Alex said as he opened my door for me.</p>
<p>I grinned.  &quot;You mean the whole pick up drop off no sex till the third date thing?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded.  &quot;We'll have to define some rules.  And uh, I only have one bed.&quot;</p>
<p>I bit my bottom lip as I leaned over to unlock his door and he slid in next to me. &quot;Maybe we'll just have to be good.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at me as I stretched what I could as I readjusted in the seat. He rolled his eyes. &quot;I don't think you know how to behave yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; I said innocently.  Though I could behave.  I did it all the time.  I just liked knowing he was looking, watching, and found me attractive.  And not in the I want to own you, fuck you and leave you type of attraction that most Venatori looked at me like. &quot;I can be good.  I just like the way you look at me.&quot; I confessed.</p>
<p>Alex smirked. &quot;I like looking at you.  We won't make it to a first date you keep moving like that.  Dressing like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These are your clothes.&quot; I complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.  Do you know how fucking hot it is having you naked in my clothes?&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;Naked in your clothes?  Isn't that...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll behave.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pouted. &quot;And if I don't want you to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now who is teasing who?&quot;  I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Only fair?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned. &quot;I suppose.  Let's go get my things.  Take Rider to the coven and we can talk all about how this is going to work.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything happen on their ride to the Venatori compound?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [3]+0 = 3)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> anything happen once they get there?</em><br>

(1d20+0: [2]+0 = 2)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Blood, Bell, Noxious</p>
<hr>
<p>We didn't really find a solution to our issue but we pulled up to the bunk house.  It should have been quiet entrance but it wasn't -- a shouting crowd was not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>&quot;That don't look good.&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;If I said, stay here you wouldn't listen would you?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a chance, lover.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;That's what I thought, so I won't say it.  Be careful and don't stand too close.&quot; I warned.</p>
<p>He looked at me strange. &quot;Oh.  Right?&quot; He put his hands together and separated them violently. &quot;Boom!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex turned off the car and we got out.  I didn't wait for him to open the door and Alex hung back a little as I walked up the stairs to the crowd in front of the door.  I heard my twins voice loud and clear.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Damien and I will not put up with your fucking shit.&quot;  He growled -- an actual growl, a low rumble in his throat that grew louder.</p>
<p>Rider's voice carried, the growl rumbled deep in my chest.  Alex grabbed my elbow to keep me from the power he and all the other Venatori felt rippling from my brother.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be okay.&quot;  I said walking up to my brother with a calm smile.  The other Venatori looked at the two of us like they were seeing double.  I gave them a smirk. &quot;Didn't know I had a brother did you?&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>Flowers bloomed below us as I put my hand on Rider's shoulder and started to trace a rune on his shirt.  His power subsided and the shadows nearby from the building and trees seemed to dance and flicker in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The Venatori looked at us, raised their preverbal pitchforks and rushed us.</p>

<p>Nox hurriedly gets his things and leaves while Alex and Rider wait for him down the road away from all the hubbub going on in the compound now.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sitting a top his vehicle nearby a short squat man shouted his orders, &quot;Get 'em boys!'&quot;.  Their charge was haphazard at best as Rider ducked behind me and the round unarmed man came at me fists blazing and landed a punch in my gut sending my stomach into throat while the second attacker stopped well short of me and fired his gun that grazed my shoulder leaving me howling in pain.</p>
<p>I manage to duck out of the way of a sword coming flying at my neck just as I feel the magic inside burst from my skin.  Nothing of note changed except that I can feel the hum of magic behind me.  Something was happening to Rider, but I couldn't do much as I pulled up on the magic and sent the cowardly gunman running with a rune drawn in the aether with raw power.</p>
<p>The chaos aura around me pulls upon the vegetation and flowers bloom under our feet.  That seems to be the theme of the day -- flowers and peace.</p>
<p>The man who shouted orders pulled his own gun but his shot went wide striking something off to my left.  A low rumble formed behind me as I felt the magic of the pack flow through my brother as he shifted.  What the fuck!</p>
<p>The low rumbled turned to a growl as he fully transitioned.</p>
<p>The round monk's fist smashed into my jaw, cracking my teeth.  The swordsman turned his attention on Rider.</p>
<p>In the distance I heard another gun shot go off and prayed that Alex was alright. I didn't have time to look to see before Rider charged past me at the round man with his claws and gouged a large chuck from the man's arm.  He screamed in pain as he missed his own attack.</p>
<p>The sword came at me again and I ducked out of its way just in time as I drew a rune of fire and sent it at the man who was shouting orders.  The rune's power shattered across their leader and he took one look at us and called out in a panic stricken voice. &quot;Retreat!  Retreat!&quot;</p>
<p>The remaining men ran into the building, their comrade from before still running away from us.  I wondered how long he'd run.</p>
<p>Rider's wolf form growled at the door and I put my hand in his thick gray fur and smiled. &quot;It's okay man.  It's okay.  I don't think I'll be going back in there.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex chuckled. &quot;No.  We can buy you new things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got a better idea.&quot;  I smiled, &quot;You take Rider out the gates and I'll meet you down the road a bit.  Just get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>I drew a run on my shirt and disappeared from their sight.  Alex stared with his jaw agape and I grinned though he couldn't see. &quot;I'll see you soon.&quot;  The shadows shifted as I walked but no one was the wiser as I entered my room and gathered my things.  I didn't want to leave without my notebook or laptop -- the rest I could do without but not the laptop.  That was hard earned money and something the Venatori wouldn't replace.  Not that they would replace anything now -- I was a fugitive now, an enemy of the state -- a traitor.</p>
<p>And I was alright with that.</p>
