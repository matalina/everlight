<p>Alex started a playlist and continued snooping through my phone. Didn't bother me, he wasn't going to find anything incriminating or even fun to look at but he seemed enthralled with something, so I kept cooking and watching him out of the corner of my eye as I did.</p>

<p>I loved cooking.  It was fulfilling and relaxing.  It wasn't taking a run or yoga, but it helped set my day right.  And I was going to need all the help I could get.</p>
<p>&quot;Just magic.&quot; Alex smirked.</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Dangerous, chaotic magic, but just magic.&quot; I agreed. &quot;And it hurts to bottle it up, makes me nauseous for hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You said that already.&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned. &quot;That's how bad it is, I'm repeating myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Padded footsteps on to the tile floor drew our attention.  &quot;So how the fuck are you with Alex all night, and at the casino too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Alex turned to look at the man behind him who I assumed was Benji. &quot;He's been with me all night.  He has a twin brother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A twin brother who looks like him, and exudes magic like him, and walks through my fucking barriers and takes them down without even casting a spell.&quot;</p>
<p>I held up my hands and laughed. &quot;Now wait just one minute.  I cannot and have never been able to walk through a ward and take it down.  Ever.  That is totally a Rider thing.&quot;  I looked to Alex and smiled. &quot;I told you I had more control with him.  He's a partial null.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Partial?&quot;  Benji asked, &quot;What the fuck is a partial null.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's half Venatori and that half is null.  He nullifies magic.  But since his other side is Sussuri, some magic affects him and you don't know what it is until it happens.  Obviously he wouldn't have done it on purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you fucking know how long it's going to take to get the ward back up?&quot;</p>
<p>I shrugged. &quot;You need the materials which are rare.  What type of ward?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anti magic, what the fuck else you think?&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed.  &quot;Are you keeping magic out?  Or trying to keep magic in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out.  Obviously!&quot;  Benji growled.  He was getting irritated at my questions.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do that, I assume the lines were drawn once?  Runes just need activating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lines need to be drawn.&quot; Benji quirked an eyebrow in my direction.</p>
<p>&quot;I can help.&quot; I offered.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's easier if you don't ask Benj.  He's got this weird fucked up thing that activates runes and draws them too just by existing.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji's eyes went wide. &quot;Raw Chaos?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah don't cast anything around him or he might blow us all up.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji frowned.  &quot;Why are you in my kitchen?&quot;  He turned to Alex.</p>
<p>&quot;Because Pedro bought boxed pancake mix and Nox has an aversion to boxed food.  Like totally allergic to it, so we had to come and make it from scratch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?  Allergic?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded. &quot;Yup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are full of shit too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope.&quot; Alex smirked.  &quot;I will not say what I wanted to as we are now in mixed company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are holding back on account of your pretty boy being here?&quot; Benji asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, because you are here.&quot;</p>
<p>I burst into a laugh. &quot;Full of cream?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex hung his head and shook his head. &quot;Do you really have to be so crude?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey you were the one thinking it not me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't the one who said it.&quot; Alex laughed.</p>
<p>I leaned down on the edge of the counter towards Benji and asked, &quot;Is he always so tight?&quot;</p>
<p>Benji turned around and walked away.  &quot;Oh my fucking god, now there are two of them.  This isn't some Venatori whore house.  This is my home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Venatori don't have whore houses.&quot;  I said. &quot;It's free love all the time, everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji walked away.  I laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Should I have not done that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bring him a plate of crepes and mixed berry compote and big glass of coffee and I'm sure he'll forgive you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For what?&quot; Alex turned his attention back to me as I slide across a cup of coffee, cream with two sugars and a plate of food. &quot;Smells divine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Should taste like it too.&quot;  I said pushing a plate into a seat next to Alex.  &quot;Let me take this to Benji.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded as he was already stuffing his mouth and drooling.  &quot;MMMM. This is good.&quot;  He mumbled through mouthfuls.</p>
<p>I carried a plate and mug through the kitchen in the direction Benji had fled and I found him poking the keys of a baby grand piano.  &quot;An apology.&quot; I offered.</p>
<p>Benji looked at me and then leaned around me to look down the hall for Alex.  &quot;He's stuffing his face.  It's apparently good.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji chuckled. &quot;Fastest way to his heart is through his stomach.&quot;</p>
<p>I pulled my lips in and refrained from my comment.</p>
<p>Benji shook his head. &quot;Alex wouldn't have held back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not Alex and I try not to offend my host more than once in ten minutes time frames.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji laughed.  &quot;Smells good.&quot;  He took the offering. &quot;He's never brought anyone home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I assume that means he's never dated anyone either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be right.&quot; Benji agreed.</p>
<p>I nodded, &quot;Good, then we are on even footing.&quot;  I gave a flamboyant bow, &quot;Enjoy your breakfast.&quot;</p>
