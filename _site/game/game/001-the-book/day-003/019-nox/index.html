<p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Sunday Morning</p>
<p>Recovery Rolls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex - 1d6+1: [2]+1 = 3, 1d6+1: [4]+1 = 5</li>
<li>Nox - 1d6+1: [5]+1 = 6</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Morning dawned in a strange bed.  Not that it wouldn't have been the case anyway since this was my first night in Everlight.  Alex was sound asleep next to me, his chest rising and falling deeply.  He looked peaceful.  The sheet slipped down his body and his chest was fully visible.  I got a good look at the tattoo on his chest and shoulder.  They covered his runes well, as I assumed he had them, he grew up Venatori, had Venatori parents.  The cross swords at his temple was visible in his sleep, the magic worn off from the prior application.  Not one you could easily disguise, which is why I didn't bother and besides, humans couldn't see it, only other supernatural beings.</p>
<p>I could stay all day staring at him.  Praying, hoping today would be a better day -- that we'd find away to get around all our historical teachings and drama points.  Universe knows I had plenty.</p>
<p>But I climbed out of bed and opened the double doors to the pool.  I could go for a run, but there was a pool right there, and it wouldn't take me far from Alex.  But I sat down on the ground in front of his pool and began my simple yoga routine.  It cleared my mind, eased my soul and started my day off on the right foot.</p>
<p>The real decision came when deciding how to swim.  They were essentially in the middle of nowhere, only the people in the big house and Alex had any view of the pool.  I could go swimming in my boxers and get them wet?  Or skinny dipping which would likely only piss Alex off.  The whole jealous idea rearing its ugly head again.</p>
<p>The question made my head spin and heart race.  So much so he forgot it all together and went back inside feeling nauseous and sweaty -- more sweaty than going for a run.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did Alex wake up?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [5]+0 = 5)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Alex still slept soundly and I smiled as I walked past and into his bathroom.  Thankfully the washer and dryer were in the bathroom, the pool house was small in comparison to the big house, but this was exactly how I liked my living spaces, easy to access and keep organized.  A house that size would drive me absolutely nuts. And I didn't need that sorta added anxiety.</p>
<p>I stripped down to nothing and washed all my clothes.  There was blood all over the t-shirt and I was sure it was starting to smell.  Then I jumped into the shower.</p>
<p>It was easy to forget my troubles with the hot water scalding my body and searing away the sweat and grossness.  The shampoo smelled of Alex as did the soap and I probably stayed too long in the water.  At least long enough for the washer to buzz the completion of its cycle.  The sound was loud and I hoped it didn't wake up Alex.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did the buzzer wake up Alex?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [20]+0 = 20)<br>
<strong>Yes, and</strong> Eye, Moan, Witness</p>
<hr>
<p>I tried off and wrapped a clean towel around my waist and used another to dry my hair.  I'd have to go without the eyeliner and I felt utterly naked without it.  I mean I was only wearing a towel but that covered the private bits, it wasn't the same sorta feeling.</p>
<p>The door opened and the first thing that caught my eye was Alex sitting up rubbing his eyes with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you I wasn't doing that with you.&quot; I growled.  I felt his eyes on me as I left his room and headed out into the living space.</p>
<p>It was the first time I'd seen Alex's living space for more than a few moments before I'd stepped outside to meditate.  Now I had time to take it all in.  A box of goods sat on the counter island in the middle of the room and I poked my head in it to see a box of pancake mix.  &quot;Really?&quot; I picked the box up and turned towards the bedroom.  &quot;You expect me to make crepes out of a box?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex strode out of his room with a pair of boxers and idly watching me stand in front of him with a towel wrapped around my waist holding up a box of pre-mixed pancakes.  &quot;How else do you plan on making them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From scratch.&quot;  I said like he insulted the very thing we were trying to do here.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea how to do that?&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes and opened all the cupboards and drawers.  The fridge too.  Everything was a little sparse but I managed to find coffee and coffee cups.  Those were counted plenty.  At least coffee would work.</p>
<p>&quot;You really want me to make breakfast out of a box?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean we could go to the big house.  I'm sure Benji's cooks have what you'd need.  But you ain't leaving the house in just a towel.&quot; He smirked. &quot;Not that I mind the view.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex closed the distance between us and cocked his head to the side.  He placed a finger to my temple. &quot;How come you got this one, but none of the others?&quot;</p>
<p>I shrugged. &quot;I didn't have Venatori parents.&quot;  I tapped the rune on Alex's shoulder underneath the mechanical robot bursting out of his skin tattoo. &quot;I was born in a human hospital.  They didn't give me the tattoo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But shouldn't they have done that once you sparked?  I mean wouldn't that have made your life easier?&quot;  Alex asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure it would have, but who was going to pay for it.  By the time I got to the Venatori my mother disowned me and my brother, gave us both up.  My father wanted nothing to do with me.  If he even knew I existed.  I was a ward with only the barest of human law to keep me fed and clothed until I came of age to hunt.  And all of what I make now goes into years of what I owe.  I have nothing but the items in my bag.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus.&quot;  Alex sighed. &quot;And so the others for the same reason.  You've no way to keep people out of your head, you run headlong into monsters without fear without the rune to help.  You see things no one else sees.  How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Theory is my mother is a non-practicing Sussuri and I was blessed with a connection to the Umbra.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is your brother so weird?&quot; Alex asked.</p>
<p>I grinned at him. &quot;Not nearly no.  He's got big energy, powerful, commanding even.  Rider says something and you just wanna do it.  And we both have a bit of a temper.  But he's not like me. And he honestly had better teachers than I did.  But Rider wasn't dangerous so the Venatori wouldn't take him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want to borrow some sweats and a t-shirt while your clothes dry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...&quot; I nodded, &quot;You wouldn't happen to have any eye liner?  I feel totally naked without it.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex's grin widened. &quot;You a re nearly naked now, I can see why.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I leave the safety of your walls I might have another anxiety attack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another one?&quot;  Alex frowned. &quot;Does that mean you've already had one today.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;I wanted to go swimming, but I didn't want to get my boxers wet, which seems a moot point now since I washed them... or to go swimming naked and I didn't want to piss you off.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex licked his lips and nodded. &quot;Thank you for that.  I would really have liked to seen you dripping wet. But I understand.  I do have eyeliner in the bathroom cabinet.  I rare it rarely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So probably old, but it'll do in a pinch.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>I followed Alex back into his room and changed in the bathroom.  We didn't need to tempt this going slow thing anymore than necessary and I was petty sure me being butt ass naked in his bedroom would push things a bit too far.</p>
