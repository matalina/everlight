        <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>The parking garage was empty of people but still full of cars.  Maybe for work?  Clean up?  Or maybe just a place to safely park while you caught the train?  I dunno.  Didn't really care.</p>
<p>Nox's hand in my felt warm.  He watched me from the corner of his eye, and I watched him.  I think my view was more entertaining.  He was still squirming about the glitter.  I was still wide eyed about that.  How the fuck did a Venatori live with magic popping off all the time like he said.  Anytime anyone used magic.  That sorta give him away.  Maybe that's why he got sent to the City of Darkness from where ever it was he hailed.  My guess was New York City.  He talked way too fast, with a slight Brooklyn accent, it sounded like he tried to hide.  But he clipped his Rs and elongated his awes.  Pretty hot if you asked me if he'd just talk like he normally did. But blending in was the name of the game -- he didn't do a very good job of it, he just needed to stop.</p>
<p>His eyes went wide when the lights on Serenity blinked.  He whistled and stood at the back of the car admiring her as I walked around the passenger side and opened the door.  He looked at me with a wide smile and his ears colored so did the base of his neck. &quot;Such a gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I try.&quot; I said closing the door after he slide into the super low seat.</p>
<p>I started my lovely and we were on the road heading towards the Promenade.  It was quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;So?&quot; I said.</p>
<p>He laughed. &quot;I'm not high anymore.&quot;  The color deepened on his neck.  &quot;So, this will sound very forward.&quot;  Nox shifted in his seat and turned towards me and leaned across the console without touching me and whispered. &quot;I so want to suck your dick, Alex.&quot;</p>
<p>If I hadn't been driving I don't know what I would have done.  But I didn't take my eyes off the road.  My heart raced.  My dick was hard.  It wasn't just anticipation, it was the fucking way he said it.</p>
<p>Nox sat back against the door, the seat belt cockeyed but he didn't look away from me.  His ears and neck were beat red and the look on his face when I glanced over at him said that his feelings hadn't changed, but maybe the action was unwarranted now that he was sober.  He smirked at me and settled back into the seat proper. &quot;Just so we are clear. Yes.  I was high.  Yes I wanted to suck your dick.  And yes, I still do, don't get me wrong.  But we only just met, and I don't fuck on the first date.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what date do you fuck on?&quot; I asked with my own smirk.</p>
<p>&quot;Third.&quot; He deadpanned.</p>
<p>&quot;So dancing counts as the first?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And breakfast counts as the second?&quot; I sounded hopeful.</p>
<p>He laughed.  It was an amazing sound, the sound of his full hearted laughter.  I wished it didn't turn me on so fucking much.  That's a lie.  I wanted to stop and watch him touch him self.  Fuck I wanted to touch him.</p>
<p>&quot;What I wouldn't give to know what thought ran through you head just then.&quot;  Nox interrupted my day dream.</p>
<p>&quot;Why's that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you blushed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, you did.&quot; He flicked my ear, &quot;Ears were pink and everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was just imaging watching you touch yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>He groaned and pressed his head backwards into the seat and readjusted his whole body in one lithe movement I wished he hadn't done.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't do that.&quot; I begged.</p>
<p>He grinned and put his hands on his thighs and sat perfectly still. &quot;I think you can take me out on our third date soon.&quot;  He sat up and looked at me with a grin, &quot;But not to a vampire club.  I want to do something you like  doing.  No movies, no dinner. Someplace we can chat and get to know each other, but also someplace that we can distract ourself with something if we find we just don't work.&quot;  He sat back proud of himself.</p>
<p>We continued on in silence.  But it wasn't awkward, it was the opposite.  Was comfortable as we watched each other, both with big smiles on our face.  He fidgeted with his fingers picking at the chipping black nail polish.</p>
<p>I pulled up to the Venatori compound and he stopped me at the gate. &quot;I'll get out here.  I don't really know where I'm going.&quot;  Was pretty sure that was a lie but I let it drop.  He was probably just making sure I didn't get caught crossing into sovereign land or something.</p>
<p>Nox climbed out of the car and leaned down to look inside at me.  &quot;Pick me up at 3pm this Wednesday and take me out.  Remember the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>I clicked my tongue and nodded. &quot;Okay.  3 on Wednesday.  I expect a text message from you with a proper address in this joint so I can come to your door.&quot;</p>
<p>He grinned. &quot;Fair.  I won't invite you inside, I have a roommate, and he's an asshole. See you Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>He wiggled his fingers at me and shut the door behind him.  He waved a fancy card in front of a pad and the gate slide open, and he disappeared behind it.  He was right about one thing.  I definitely didn't want to go inside there, but I kinda wanted to see where he lived.</p>
<p>I went home the fastest way possible.  I needed a cold shower.  Not that it helped, my mind wandered to the many thoughts of the night.  When I got back to my bed, my phone had a missed text.  Who the fuck was messaging me at 4am.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Nox<br>
Since you like watching me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next message was a link to his SMP account to a specific video he posted.</p>
<p>The idea that this hot as fuck guy just sent me a naughty video made me even harder than I was when I came back to bed.</p>
<p>I tossed my blankets back and crawled in to bed with my phone.  It wasn't a thing I usually did.  No screens in bed -- a rule I tried to live by.  But...</p>
<p>I clicked the link after getting comfortable and it opened up to a video of him doing a choreographed number side by side with a music video.  It wasn't the full song but we had danced to it only a few hours ago.</p>
<p>He was right, I liked watching him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Alex<br>
not what I expected but wow! love the way you tease me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched him dance.  I was going to dream about his sexy body and his laughter.</p>
