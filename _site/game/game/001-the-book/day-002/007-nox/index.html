<p>Everything felt good.  Hot guy felt good.  Smelt good.  Oranges and citrus and his personal musk from sweating on the dance floor.  Everything was amazing and when he started swearing as we left I was sure I fucked something up.</p>
<p>But he tugged me through the crowd away from the bar and when we finally reached the cool air of the night I was spiraling down a rabbit hole of rejection despite the way my body and mind felt.</p>
<p>We walked away from the club, his hand warm in mind, but my body was cooling rapidly.  Hot guy stalked down the road, even the number of cars was less than I expected at this hour.  What hour was it?</p>
<p>&quot;What time is it?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Hot guy stopped and stared at me.  &quot;Fuck!&quot;  I didn't know what he saw, but he didn't like it none-the-less.  My freakout freaked out more, but my body still felt good.  Something was definitely wrong.</p>
<p>He looked at his phone and sighed. &quot;Almost 4 in the morning.  Fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hungry.&quot;  I looked at him.  &quot;What's your name?  Cause if you told me, I've forgotten and I'd really like to say something to you, but I'd rather say your name when saying it.&quot;  Something was definitely wrong.  My lack of charm was showing.</p>
<p>&quot;Food will help.  Come on.&quot;  He clasped my hand harder and lead me into a parking lot and into a very crowded diner.  But he took a seat at the bar and shoved me into the one next to him.</p>
<p>I ordered steak and eggs and a large pot of coffee.  Which the waitress brought as a single cup.  &quot;That's not going to be enough.&quot;  My head was already starting to hurt.</p>
<p>We ate in near silence, Mr. Broody Pants next to me grumbling and scowling the whole time.  I didn't want to interrupt.  And besides he was kinda cute  when he was angry.</p>
<p>I ordered pumpkin pie when I was finished and another pot of coffee.  I had managed to polish off the one before that much to our servers surprise.</p>
<p>The diner was nearly empty by the time the pie came, we sat at the bar and I felt better -- felt the distinct shift of magic and then there was the sound of a balloon popping and fucking glitter rained down from above.</p>
<p>The waitress, in the moment before, placed a fresh cup of coffee on the counter, and the pumpkin pie with it glorious mound of whipped cream -- the only real splurge of the night.  And fucking glitter decorated it all.</p>
<p>I jumped back from the stool stumbling over my own feet and fell backwards on to my ass.  &quot;Arg!&quot; I growled.</p>
<p>My friend, who had yet to share his name looked at me, looked at the glitter covering the area I had been sitting in.  He looked up with the waitress and then they both looked at me as I shook the fucking sparkles from my hair and body and I was going to be covered in this metallic shit for months.  Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</p>
<p>&quot;What the fuck just happened?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up at him.  His ice-blue eyes staring down at me in amusement.  The brooding seemed to have lifted at least for a little while.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to explain.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>He offered me his hand and I scowled at it. &quot;I still don't know your name!&quot; I said as I took it.</p>
<p>He blinked at me. &quot;Alex. It's Alex. You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fucking nepenthe!&quot; I growled.</p>
<p>The waitress giggled. &quot;I ain't never seen nepenthe do that. Seen them come in with blood dripping from their eyes on nepenthe.  Never once in all this time being so close to that club have I seen glitter flutter about happily decorating the place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Happily?  Glitter is the fucking herpes of the art world.  Once you get that shit you can't get rid of it.&quot;  I growled.</p>
<p>Alex was chuckling. &quot;I don't think he likes glitter.&quot;  He plucked at a few pieces that were littering my shoulder. &quot;Though it adds to his charm.&quot;  Alex dropped money on the counter and tugged me out the door.  &quot;That wasn't the nepenthe, she's right.  Nepenthe doesn't do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nepenthe doesn't do that to you, or her, or anyone else I fucking know.  It could have been worse than glitter.  So much fucking worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't get it.&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>I shrugged. &quot;Hard to explain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try me.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed. &quot;Okay. When people use magic around me it has a tendency to cause fucked up shit to happen. Glitter bombs being annoying, but I've seen random fires start, things floating in the air, sometimes all magic gets fucked up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you are saying that nepenthe is making things happen because it's magic?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nepenthe is made from the blood of supernatural creatures so yeah it's fucking magic.  It's fucking chaos itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So if I were to say, do this.&quot; Alex waved his hand in front of him and a small flame popped into the palm of his hand.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Chaos Aura</em>: 1d20: [6] = 6 -&gt; A Patch of Wildflowers Bloom Instantly</p>
<hr>
<p>As we walked flowers sprouted at my feet, bloomed in purples, reds and yellows until he closed his hand and the flame died.</p>
<p>&quot;You could have blown us up.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Alex shook his head. &quot;You aren't high anymore, so why did nepenthe cause that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because it changed in magical effect.  I'll pop off again in the morning or sometime when the whole shit and shebange is gone from my system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you could blow yourself up because some fucking vampire spiked our punch?&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Yeah.  Though I'm pretty sure it was airborne.  Though you still smell like oranges so maybe the water was spiked.  But that would have been a whole other emotion.&quot;</p>
<p>We walked across the main street towards the parking garage. &quot;I should get home. I'm sure they'll be missing me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me drop you off.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Notice Alex's tattoo (12)</em><br>
(1d20: [13] = 13)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>Automatic Success</strong><br>
(1d20: [20] = 20)</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;You wanna go near the Venatori even though you are trying so hard <em>not</em> to be Venatori?&quot; I asked. When Alex had pulled upon the flame in his hand, the tattoo at his temple had appeared.  I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I wasn't trying to figure him out, the information he'd been hiding before.</p>
<p>Alex looked at me like he didn't know what I was talking about.  I tapped my right temple. &quot;You're Venatori is showing.&quot; I smirked.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck!&quot; Alex growled. &quot;I used the same spell.  Shit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No harm.&quot; I said. &quot;I can catch the train, if it's still running.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take you,&quot; Alex said.  He pressed his fingers to his right temple and the crossed swords tattoo vanished.  &quot;And while I drive you to the compound you can tell me whatever it is you wanted to say to me when you found out my name.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>
