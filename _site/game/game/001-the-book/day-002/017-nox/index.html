<hr>
<p>We drove in near silence.  I was drained, so drained.  I rested and regained some of my composer in the few minutes we took to drive down the road.  But I didn't dare reach into the chaos to heal faster.</p>
<p>We slowed and Alex groweled.  &quot;I forgot the amplitheater had a thing going today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who's playing?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Eternal Eclipse is in town.  They have a few shows.&quot;</p>
<p>I sat up and looked over at him.  &quot;Are you shittin me?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex grinned. &quot;Absolutely not.  I'm well aware of your playlist, you went on and on about it.  I think the only one better would be Troye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would never go see Troye.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex laughed, &quot;Why the fuck not!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh I don't know, my heart might not make it.  I might be utterly useless afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to watch you at one of his concerts.&quot;  Alex said, looking  at me through the corner of his eyes.  &quot;Actually I think I'd like to watch you at any concert for that matter.  I think I know exactly where I'll take you on Wednesday now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are still on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.  I was an ass.  You were an ass.  You are tired, and I'm self, I want these rumored crepes and compote and you in my bed.  Even if there is no hanky panky.&quot;</p>
<p>I giggled.  &quot;Hanky Panky?&quot;  I giggled again.</p>
<p>Alex laughed.  &quot;I love making you laugh.&quot;  He said with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you like will like making me make other sounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex shook his head and chuckled. &quot;And he's back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never really left.  I get grumpy when the chaos is thick.  I need an hour with some quiet and I'll be right as rain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An hour huh?  What am I supposed to do in that time?  Watch you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you like.  I wouldn't mind, it's just me sitting on the floor so it's rather boring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see.&quot; Alex said as we pulled into a wooded drive.</p>
<p>The house that  sat in the center of the clearing was grand and opulent.  Alex pulled around the drive and behind the house to a much smaller garage and house.  The pool sparkled in the moon light.</p>
<p>&quot;Fancy.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Alex parked the car and I stayed put as he walked around and opened my door.  &quot;You like me opening the door for you?&quot;</p>
<p>I cocked my head to the side with a grin, &quot;I like you being in control if that's what you mean?&quot; I stood up with the door between us and grinned across at him and whispered. &quot;And I am very much a bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex growled. &quot;At least I got you home before flirty sexy guy returned.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;I still need that hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot; Alex sighed as he took my hand and we walked to his front door and he unlocked the door.  &quot;I don't think the housekeeper has been through yet.&quot;  He said flipping on the light in the living room.  I expected to see the typical bachelor pad with take out boxes and beer bottles scattered around.  The only thing I saw that looked like it didn't belong was the towel that hung over the back of a barstool and a half eaten bag of oreo cookies -- chocolate double stuffed.  At least he liked chocolate I grinned.</p>
<p>He gave me a quick tour of his living area.  It consisted of the open kitchen looking out into the living room with a large flat screen tv hung on the wall all with modern lines and a beach front atmosphere.  Other than that it looked like someone staged the set up and no one lived here.</p>
<p>&quot;You sure you live here?&quot; I asked playfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till you see the bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you have another towel hanging on a chair.  Is that your décor?&quot; I teased and then laughed. &quot;At least you have a décor, everything I own fits into a duffle bag.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex frowned.  His eyes sad as he pointed to a clear spot on the floor in front of his coffee table.  &quot;Is that enough room?  Or do you need more?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mind if I sit by the pool?&quot; I asked. &quot;The fresh air is nice. Don't get the opportunity to sit outside often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; He asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I live in a very tall skyscraper and no windows in my very tiny room I shared with three other boys. My studio was just me but still no windows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, as long as you aren't going to be naked.&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned. &quot;I'll save the naked parts for inside with you -- alone in the shower maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex growled. &quot;Out then.  Do your thing and come find me when you are done I'll be somewhere.  Sure you can find me it's not that big of a place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.  A little hide and seek.  I think I can manage.  It is my job afterall.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex rolled his eyes.  &quot;One hour, your clock starts now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In reality the hour could have started the moment we got in the car.  I just hadn't focused on it.&quot;</p>
<p>It was quiet out here, as I sat down at the edge of the pool and crossed my legs.  The smell of salt water tickled my nose.  No chlorine here, I thought to myself as I dipped my fingers in the water and just let the chaos go.</p>
<p>Meditation wasn't always about calm, somedays the chaos boiled inside me, it would race and explode with all the built up tension for the day.  Tonight despite the explosion it ebbed in a calm flow, like the water in the pool.  I let it take me.</p>
<hr>
<p>1 hour rest &amp; rewrite cyphers<br>
Recovery roll: 1d6+1: [3]+1 = 4</p>
<hr>
<p>And when the hour was up I went in search of Alex.  But I didn't track him down, I took the opportunity to check out his house -- which was probably the whole point of it.</p>
