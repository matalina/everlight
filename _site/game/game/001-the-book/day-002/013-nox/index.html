<p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Evening</p>
<hr>
<p>We drove south east through Elysium.  I actually got to sight see as we drove.  The Church of the Damned passed on the right as we turned towards the Enclave.  The church was much the same as the one in New York.  Though probably it was the other way around, as this was the original.  If you didn't know better you'd think it was a Catholic church and not a church that worshiped vampires.</p>
<p>Alex chuckled as I stared out the window.  &quot;First time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Outside of New York, absolutely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A virgin.  I like it.  Maybe I'll break that cherry on Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>I bit my lips and pulled them in trying not to laugh.  Though I know there was a reddening of my ears and neck.  It wasn't embarrassment.  Sex wasn't something I was ashamed of, but knowing we were definitely on the same page made me blush.</p>
<p>&quot;Too easy.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;You have absolutely no idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I do.&quot; Alex said with a smirk.</p>
<p>We drove past Frozen, the line was already wrapping around the building. &quot;Looks like we'll be waiting in line.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only if you want to.&quot; Alex grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's magic, we should probably not do it.&quot;  I put my hands together and blew them apart making an explosion sound.</p>
<p>Alex nodded. &quot;I keep forgetting about that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can try to avoid it, but it costs me.&quot; I said. &quot;Seems pointless, when we can stand in line and flirt, maybe make out some like everyone else.&quot; I licked my lips in anticipation.</p>
<p>Alex growled.  &quot;Okay food.  We can walk across the street from the garage.&quot;</p>
<p>We parked in the garage, Alex chose a place in a corner where his car was safe from other cars.  &quot;Stay here.&quot;  He said as he got out of the car and came around to open my door.</p>
<p>I slid out of the low seat and stood in front of him with the door between us.  I bit my lip and smiled at him through the gesture.  &quot;We might not make it long tonight.&quot;  I said stepping away from the car.</p>
<p>Alex chuckled and closed the door behind me. &quot;You might be right. Those pants glued on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could find out.&quot;  I teased.</p>
<p>Alex growled and caught up to me grabbing my hand and squeezed my fingers. &quot;You are a fucking tease.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not teasing.  Just reminding you what's on the table as the third date.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck me.&quot; Alex muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Alex had enough, he stopped me near the cement pillar and pushed me up against it and pressed his lips to mine.  I let out a small moan and he slipped his tongue over my bottom lip and the kiss deepened.  My hand went behind his neck pulling him tighter against my lips pushing his tongue deeper.</p>
<p>Moments passed. Alex's fingers were digging into my hip when his stomach rumbled very loudly interrupting our kiss.  Alex's face was so close we were breathing the same air. He grinned. &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed.  All sorts of hungers.  Shall we eat, go grab a drink at Frozen and do some looking, and then...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back to my place, since your brother is at yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One thing?&quot; Alex asked. and I hummed in response. He leaned in and whispered, &quot;Stop teasing me.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed.  &quot;I can't promise anything.  But I'll try.&quot;  I slipped past Alex and took his hand as I did and lead him the way we'd been going.</p>
<p>The restaurant across the street had a pink sign with pink flower petals fluttering down on the screen.  &quot;Sakura Garden.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great.&quot;</p>
<p>We headed inside.  It was a quintessential Japenese restaurant.  It smelled like one too, it wasn't unpleasant but I wasn't a fan of Japenese food. Mostly because the places served shellfish.</p>
<p>&quot;Kennedy,&quot; Alex said to the hostess.</p>
<p>&quot;Right this way.&quot;</p>
<p>We followed and were sat down.  Alex ordered some white wine.  He frowned when he looked over the menu at me.  &quot;Not a fan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what I want.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex smirked and set his menu down. &quot;What are you having?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will have the Ramen if it's not seafood based.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chicken or Vegetable stock can be used.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No shellfish at all.&quot; I said.  &quot;Unless you want to be the avatar of my death.  Highly allergic.  That was a fun revelation.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex nodded. &quot;Honey.  Bees too, not that I've been stung by them often, only once.  But honey nearly killed me as a kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will keep that in mind. Anything else you are deathly allergic to? Latex, leather? Glycerin, parabens? Red dye #4?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Alex laughed. He leaned forward, &quot;Are you?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head.  &quot;Just making sure.  Didn't want to play and find out we were about to invest in an ambulance ride naked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did I ask you?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned. &quot;Not to tease you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to apologize.  It's not my fault you get turned on by common words and phrases.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh huh.&quot;  Alex couldn't take his eyes off me.</p>
<p>&quot;I like your shirt.&quot; I said. &quot;But the answer to that is, no fucking way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the most evil man I have ever met.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not evil.  Fucking turned on.&quot;  I admitted.</p>
<p>The young man who was our server blushed as he walked in on the tail end of our conversation.</p>
<p>Alex smiled, &quot;See you are embarrassing Ed here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's because Ed grew up in a world where sex was not talked about.&quot;  I sat back. &quot;You and I both know that's not how we were raised.&quot;</p>
<p>Ed's ears were fire red and he cleared his throat twice before he was able to speak.  &quot;What can I get you?&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to quick but Alex gave me that look that said shut up.  So I did.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have two ramen bowls, no seafood of any kind and make sure that none of it touches, we have a seafood allergy at the table and we'd hate to have an allergic reaction. Chicken broth preferable.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man nodded, &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>I so wanted to say something but Alex's eyes on mine prevented me from speaking.  I just bit my bottom lip and watched him order for me.</p>
<p>&quot;Water with lemon when we have dinner for him.  I'll just have a coke.&quot;</p>
<p>Ed jotted everything down and left in a hurry.  Alex chided me.  &quot;You are scaring the staff.&quot;</p>
<p>I just smiled and Alex leaned forward, waving me with a small gesture that I should do the same thing.  It wasn't a secret, he wanted privacy. &quot;You listened well, I expected defiance.  That gonna be a thing?&quot;</p>
<p>I smirked. &quot;Oh, Alex. Wesley has nothing on me.&quot;</p>
<p>He quirked an eyebrow and I quoted a favorite movie, &quot;As you wish.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex chuckled, &quot;Inconceivable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that word means what you think it does.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex grinned at me.  &quot;Other than cheezie old movies what else you like?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like cheezie old movies.  I like pop culture and that is a lot of quotes to things I've never seen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've never seen The Princess Bride?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head.  &quot;Haven't seen most things.  As a Ward of the Venatori I lived without most things people take for granted -- which included television, clothes some years and basic necessities other ones.  All depended on which roster I landed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what we can do this weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned at him.  &quot;As long as there is making out like teenagers on a couch I'll sit and watch a movie or two with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are a horn dog aren't you.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;Dry spell.&quot; I said.  It was sell imposed, but still the truth.</p>
