  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Evening</p>
<hr>
<p>The shouting behind us drew Nox's attention away from me.  It irked me.  The kiss he laid on the girl irked me even more.  I almost felt sorry for the guy who was fighting with Nox.  He was trained to kill supernatural creatures, a puny human was nothing in comparison.</p>
<p>I went to go help but Nox stayed me with a hand.  I didn't like watching him get hurt -- more.  He'd already taken a beating and his shirt still bore the marks of the damage even if he didn't act hurt.</p>
<p>The girl headed in his direction and I introduced myself, and we both watched my pretty boy handle the offensive jackass without actually ever hurting him or casting magic.  He could have easily subdued the guy.  But that would have outed him to mundanes.  Not that here in Everlight it was an issue.  Everyone was used to a little bit of strange.</p>
<p>Most of our interactions with the girl were expected. Nox talked too much, and then he trashed her number while I just tucked my phone away.</p>
<p>His words echoed in my ears as the bouncer said next and I paid the cover fee and we headed inside.</p>
<p>Nox took the time to look around like a good Venatori.  He didn't bother with the exits, he knew them.  He didn't seem to bother with the cameras either, but then again he didn't look like he was taking note of much.  Talking here was not going to work.  And that irked me.</p>
<p>He must have sensed my annoyance as he grabbed my hand and lead me down a long quiet hall probably off limits but no one seemed to stop them either. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked softly without all the flirting.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; I lied.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Deceive Nox (eased x2) (6)</em><br>
(1d20: [13] = 13)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>PC Enabler</strong><br>
Mould, Step, Ball<br>
(1d20: [15] = 15)</p>
<hr>
<p>He looked at me, cocking his head to the side deciding if I was telling the truth.  He however did not indicate whether or not he believed me, he only nodded. &quot;The note said it was in the safe they last saw it.  But that was 30 years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's where they say it is still.&quot;  I said back and headed towards the bar where I could get a drink and we could look in on the glass walls of the office.</p>
<p>I ordered a high dollar whiskey.  Nox ordered water with lemon.  He hadn't partaken of the wine either.  He hadn't seemed to mind being high, but then there was nothing either of us could have done it.  He smiled at me but it was hardly flirty.  He was all business, and I wasn't sure I liked that.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nox cast Stim.<br>
<em><strong>Q:</strong> Nox find the safe from the bar floor (easedx4) (0)</em></p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura:</em> (1d20: [1] = 1)  -&gt; 4 of air damage to anyone in a short distance</p>
<hr>
<p>Nox drew a rune on his hand and mumbled something. A burst of air pushed everything around Nox away from him.  &quot;What the fuck!&quot; shouted everyone around him, like someone had pushed them.  He kept a straight face and looked straight ahead.</p>
<p>I stepped back into Nox putting my hand on the small of his back, &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; I whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Chaos.&quot; He said.  &quot;I found the safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You cast a spell to find it?&quot;  I asked.</p>
<p>Nox shrugged. &quot;Sorta.  I just enhanced my gift of finding patterns. It could have been fire.&quot;  The latter he added with a cringe.</p>
<p>&quot;We should go.  You are getting all sorts of eyes.  They see the swords. They'll report you if they think you'll make trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox nodded and followed after me.  He snaked a long finger into my belt loop and followed behind me.  We hadn't been there for more than a few minutes.  I barely had a two sips of my drink.  When we were well away from the club and the quiet of the street, if you could call the busy street quiet.  &quot;You could have waited to do that till I finished my drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;  He said, though he didn't sound sorry, nor did he sound happy.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You lied to me.  But whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>I growled. &quot;I have not lied to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what the fuck was wrong before?&quot;  He stopped and glared at me.  If looks could kill I'd be dead and in Hell already.</p>
<p>I frowned.  &quot;You didn't have to go over there.  Nor kiss the girl.  Or offer to keep her safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I thought.&quot;  He said and turned around and head towards the subway station at the other end of the street.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; I shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Home.&quot;  He said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you too!&quot; I shouted after him.</p>
<p>He turned around on his heels in one quick and graceful movement and I don't know how he did it but he was just there. I must have blinked.  His finger was in my face and he was glaring so hard, there was fire in his eyes, and not the good kind we'd been flinging before.</p>
<p>Nox growled and clenched his fingers and stepped back and closed his eyes and drew a deep calming breath.  He counted visibly and in a hushed mumble as he calmed his anger.  I could feel the magic boiling around him, and I didn't always sense my own magic.  The chaos boiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you like being teased and tormented?&quot; he whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and took another step back, &quot;Do you?  Is it something you like?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who the fuck likes it?&quot; I shouted, probably louder than I needed to.</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine every day of your life someone calls you names, tells you you are fat, or ugly, or that you are dumb.&quot;</p>
<p>And that's what when I understood why he did it.  &quot;That girl had been stood up by so called friends and then tormented by an asshat.&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;I didn't have to do any of it.  I didn't have to stand up for her.  I didn't have to kiss her or offer to keep her safe. But if someone had done that for me once, just once, I'd have been so grateful.  So I do it when I can.  As for trashing her number, what's the point of keeping it in my phone I'm going to never call.  I don't like girls for one, and there was no connection what the fuck-so-ever.  I was thinking about you when I kissed her. She tasted nothing like you.&quot;  He said.  His shoulders slumped and he shook his head. &quot;Look, I'm sorry.  I will do my best not to piss you off again, but I'm drained now.  I'd rather not heal quickly and risk the chance of another blast going off.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked like shit. &quot;At least come back to my place, you can still make me breakfast.&quot;  Yes, I was a selfish bastard, I wanted crepes and fucking berry compote for fucks sake.</p>
<p>He grinned at me. &quot;I can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>I offered him my hand and he reached out and took it. He was hot to the touch.  I felt more of the chaos around him than I should have.  But I pulled him closer, it seemed to help.</p>
<p>Once we made it to the parking garage he stopped short of the car and I turned to look at him.  His gaze was cast down and I wanted to ask him what was wrong but he pulled me in for the softest gentlest kiss I could expect from someone his size.  He wrapped his arms around me and the kiss was tempered with tears falling hot down his cheeks.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't break the spell.  He was casting a spell on me and I knew in that moment I was going to do everything possible to keep him from that soft kiss and tears again.</p>
<p>It had tasted like home and safety, and he needed the closeness.  Needed the acceptance.</p>
<p>When he finally pulled away it was with a shy blush and a smile.  He didn't apologize but I felt the 'sorry' on the air.  But he didn't say it.</p>
<p>I opened the door and then walked around watching him lean over and unlock the door.  I'd purposefully left it for him.  He was smiling happily when I opened the door and slid in next t o him.  I started Serenity and we left and were on the busy streets before I reached over and put my hand on his knee.  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me too.&quot;  He said as he settled in and closed his eyes, even though it wouldn't take too long to get home, at least if traffic kept at its current fast pace.</p>
