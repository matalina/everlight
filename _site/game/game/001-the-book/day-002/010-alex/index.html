  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Morning</p>
<hr>
<p>About 10am while I was still in bed I got a text.  It woke me from a dream of a sexy body dancing for me nearly naked -- or at least I had hoped he was.  The sound burst through my dreams with a piercing crack of a whip and my eyes shot open.  Why the fuck did I choose that sound?  It was jarring at best, though I expected in my coming down from the forced nepenthe hangover I felt it apt.  Nox already had me whipped, it was apt as I sat up and grabbed my phone from the bedside stand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Nox<br>
Hey.  Call me when you have a free moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I flopped back in bed and pressed call.  Might as well see what's going on that he wanted me to call.  It didn't feel like a social call.</p>
<p>It rang and after the second one Nox answered. &quot;Hey Alex. I'm sorry did I wake you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's alright. I should get up.  What did you need?  As I assume because it was a flirty text with teasing links that it's important.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not important.  Well not like do or die.  Well maybe it is do or die.  Sorry. I was wondering if you'd like to go to Frozen with me?  I have been tasked with getting a book from a safe.&quot;</p>
<p>I sat up straight in bed and smiled. &quot;Oh really?  What's the Venatori want with a vampire book?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing good I'm sure.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did Nox learn anything new about the passage when he was looking at it? (eased x2) (6)</em><br>
(1d20: [4] = 4)<br>
<strong>Fail</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>And...</strong><br>
Pleasant, Scary, Disastrous<br>
(1d20: [4] = 4)</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;But in the journal I saw, there were sketches of runes. I didn't get a good look though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are getting the book why?&quot;</p>
<p>He sighed. &quot;I do it or they'll kill me.  At least try.  Won't be the first time, but I dunno.  I figure I can check it out, see what is up and we can pretend it's a third date.  Stay off the dance floor and hope they don't nepenthe the whole place.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought about it. Seeing him would be nice.  He was going after the same thing I was, but how did I get it away from him if he wanted it too.  &quot;I'm in.&quot; I said with little hesitation.</p>
<p>&quot;When would you like to pick me up?  Or would you like to meet there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I don't pick you up how are you getting there?&quot; I asked.  I knew the answer, and it was out of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;I would take the train, same way we got there yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the question.  No way.&quot; I smiled to myself. &quot;I'll pick you up at seven, for dinner and then we'll go to Frozen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good.&quot; I could hear the grin in his voice.  &quot;I'll be there with bells on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With literal bells on?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you'll just have to wait and see.  See you at seven.  I'll text you which building I'm in. Later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later, Pretty Boy.&quot; I said as he hung up.  Date number three back to the place we met to plan a heist.  I think I was faling in love.</p>
<p>I called Benji.  He answered groggily, &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, it turns out the Pretty Boy needs the book.&quot; I said. &quot;He's invited me to recon the club.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He told you what he was doing?&quot; Benji asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He did.  Very honest about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So not you.  How does this change our plans?&quot;</p>
<p>I shrugged, &quot;No idea.  But it puts a problem in our way if he needs to book too and I want it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what got you so up in up on this book.  Never seen you like this with a commission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a commission.  A fucking dream keeps pulling me at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talk to your dad about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty sure my mother would shit a brick if she knew I knew who my father was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since when do you care about what your mom thinks?&quot; Benji asked. &quot;You left the Venatori she all but killed you when you did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's just the Venatori talking.  If she was truly pissed she would have killed me.  But Mom's always had a little rebel in her, I mean she did love my dad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can go round and round in circles about that Alex, never changes a thing.  The Venatori are fucked up people and you need to stay away from that Pretty Boy.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed. &quot;I know.  I should.  But...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck him and get it over with, Alex.&quot; Benji growled at me.  &quot;Let those big brown eyes stare up at you while he sucks your dick and then get over him.  He's going to fuck it all up.  The Venatori always do.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji wasn't wrong.  &quot;I know... I'll talk to you later.  Tomorrow for breakfast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could come over now for breakfast, Chef Tito is making something I can't wait to taste it smells so good.&quot;</p>
<p>I frowned. &quot;Yeah I guess.  I need a shower and I'll be over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Food might be gone.  Dunno...&quot; Benji said laughing as he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Benji wasn't wrong.  But there was something about the pretty boy with those big brown eyes and it was more than just wanting to sleep with him.  I wasn't even sure that was why I was drawn to him.  It felt almost like the draw to the fucking book, except I wasn't dreaming about him.  At least I wasn't until I saw him.  Now I couldn't get him out of my head.</p>
