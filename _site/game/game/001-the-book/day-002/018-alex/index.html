        <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Night</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Alex get ahold of someone to get breakfast supplies?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [11]+0 = 11)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Fetid, Web, Success</p>
<hr>
<p>I walked away from him.  But I watched him from my bedroom doors.  He sat at the pool side leaning over the edge dipping his fingers in the water before just sitting there.  I thought I might see something, some form of magic, but he just sat there enveloped in the silence of the light and dim pool of light from the security lights.</p>
<p>He sat still long enough they flipped off and I blinked dazed at the darkness now encompassing the pool outside.  With a heavy sigh I made a call.</p>
<p>&quot;Benji,&quot; I shouted into the phone when my friend picked up. &quot;Tomorrow, breakfast, my place.  If I can have your guys stock my fridge and pantry with real food.  Stuff to make crepes and mixed berry compote.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Benji said groggily, &quot;What the fuck, Alex.  Call Pedro yourself.&quot;  And he hung up.</p>
<p>I texted him</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info]<br>
Breakfast my place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully he'd get it and come, if not it was truly his loss.  Though I would rather be alone with Nox.  So I sent another text back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info]<br>
Make that lunch.  You can have leftovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe, if there were any left.  But I sent Pedro a text and hoped he fill my fridge while we slept.</p>
<p>I still had time to kill.  I could stare into the darkness and wonder what he was thinking about, or what he was doing.  But my mind would wander into things I didn't really want to think about.  Things we should let lie and leave alone -- we were back to a good place, even if he was drained.</p>
<p>The pretty boy sitting outside by the pool liked music.  I liked music, fancied myself a musician until I realized I wasn't nearly as good as I thought I was.  But that was lack of practice, music ran in my blood, just like being Venatori and Sussuri did.</p>
<p>I sat down with my guitar in the lounge chair in my bedroom and started strumming.  Wasn't anything particular, just chords mostly. The notes made me sink into conversations Nox and I had over dinner.  His obsession with a particular artist, and a particular song both irking me and turning me on at the same time.  Celebrity crushes were hardly something to worry about.  But Nox hadn't been in Frozen for more than a few minutes before he scored a pass up into the offices of the owner of the club.  And I had a feeling it wasn't the first time it'd happened to him.  There was just something about him.</p>
<p>Inspiration struck.  Though not really, more like I wanted Nox's attention all to myself.  I pulled up the artist on my phone and started scrolling through listening to ones I liked and picked one.  It wasn't really at random but it could have been.  It was catchy and there wasn't a lot of guitar, but I could swing it.</p>
<p>I stuck in the ear bud and scrolling lyrics like I was gonna sing at karaoke night and started picking it up.</p>
<p>I lost track of time in the music and lyrics.  They were becoming part of my soul and I could almost play and sing it without help of either.  I looked out the double doors from my room to find my pretty boy standing there silhouetted by the moon light.  The security light had gone out which meant he'd been there a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep going.&quot;  He smiled at me. &quot;I could watch you all day.&quot;  Nox bit his bottom lip and I growled to myself. &quot;Can I be honest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you ever dishonest?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Nox chuckled. &quot;I try not to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then by all means break it down.&quot; I poked fun at his honesty.</p>
<p>He stepped into the bedroom and closed the doors behind him.  &quot;I like <em>him</em>.&quot; He said alluding to the singer he'd talked about at dinner.  He squatted down in front of me, looking up at me with a hunger in his eyes. &quot;But <strong>you</strong> make me so much hotter. But I truly could listen to you sing all day. Will you sing it again for me?&quot;</p>
<p>That hadn't been what I'd thought he'd say.  I nodded and started playing again.  It felt odd playing the song now with Nox so close.  He closed his eyes and balanced on the balls of his feet in front of me.  It was like he knew how it was making me feel.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.  I don't know why I was nervous, he'd heard me playing it for a while already.  So I just took the leap and opened my eyes.  I sang and played a song he liked and watched as he got lost in the music in front of me.  He mouthed the words and I knew he was totally into it.  A stab of jealousy struck and when the song ended I grabbed my phone and pulled the earbuds out.  &quot;You owe me a dance!&quot;</p>
<p>I quickly found the song and it started blasting through the phone's speakers.</p>
<p>Nox remained squatting where he'd been, his eyes still closed.  &quot;It bothers you I find him attractive, doesn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; I lied.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lost in you, just then, not him. But whatever.&quot; He said. &quot;I'm tired. I can sleep on the couch?&quot;  It was formed as question.  He was going to stay but he wasn't sure of his welcome.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that where you want spend the night?&quot; I asked.  I wasn't sure what was really going on.  Was I acting angry?</p>
<p>&quot;I'd rather not. But we are moving too fast.  And you are jealous of simple things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not jealous!&quot; I countered in a shout.  Almost too loud for myself.</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;Alright, then whatever you want to call it.  First it was the girl at the club, now it's a rockstar making you uncomfortable because his music is good, and he's hot.  I get why he makes you uncomfortable, but there is absolutely nothing ever going to come from that crush.  It's a crush, on a person I'll never meet.  And I sure as fuck wouldn't ruin a real relationship with some guy who probably has so many men and women already at his feet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You kissed her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a ruse, a game.  It was just a kiss.  How many guys you fucked when you were younger that meant nothing, Alex.  How many girls? Was kissing them something bigger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't fucking share!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I.  I wasn't sharing myself with them. It was a fucking kiss.  It's just music.  Use the goddamn music to your advantage.  You were doing really great there for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed and jammed my fingers through my hair and grabbed a fistful with a growl.</p>
<p>He was still squatting where he had been only now his head was hanging and his eyes were closed. If we were in the middle of a stupid fight I'd have thought he was showing off his core strength.  But he wasn't.  He was sad.  The hunch in his shoulders spoke more than the strength on display.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do we do about this?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Go slower.  Get to know each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. But you are here already.&quot;  I sighed.  I tugged on my hair and dropped my hands to my sides.</p>
<p>&quot;No sex till a real third date?  I won't stop flirting, and I could never promise I wouldn't drop sex into the conversation whenever it fit in.&quot;  He looked up at me with a smile. &quot;I'd like to spend the night.  We can hold each other. I think we can manage to keep our hands above the belt.  No showers together.  As much as I'd like to see you naked with rivelts of water running down your body.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed.  And his smile brightened as he stood up.  I rolled my eyes.  &quot;I think we can mange.  And you'll still manage breakfast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;  He took a step closer.  &quot;And we can still kiss, make out like teenagers as long as hands stay above the belt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was never very good at that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've never done it.&quot; Nox admitted.</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Alright.  Slow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slow.&quot; He agreed. Nox closed the distance between and reached up and caressed my check with the back of his hand and whispered, &quot;My youth, my youth is yours, a truth so loud you can't ignore.&quot;</p>
<p>We stared into each other's eyes just standing there until he blinked and his gaze dropped to the floor.  I patted the side of the bed closest to me. &quot;This side okay?  I'm used to the other side.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled. &quot;It's fine.&quot;</p>
<p>I walked around to the other side of the bed and when I turned around I saw him pulling his shirts off over his head.  He was so fucking hot.  Skin unmarked by scars and ink except the tattoo at his temple.  I had more Venatori ink than he did.  I had more ink in general, but he didn't have the other marks we were given as children.</p>
<p>Nox sloughed off his jeans leaving him in just a pair of black boxers as he crawled into bed.  My mouth was watering.  He closed his eyes and put his arms behind his head with smug smile on his lips. &quot;Jerk.&quot; I growled at him.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't do anything.&quot; He turned his head and looked at me. &quot;You want me to watch you?&quot;</p>
<p>I blushed.  Not embarrassed but he was blunt.  Very blunt when it came to his words and his attraction to me.  He made me so fucking nervous.  I couldn't say no.  I did want him to watch, but I didn't.</p>
<p>I pulled the shirts over my head and chucked my jeans into the hamper in the corner and crawled into bed next to him, wondering what he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;I like boxer briefs.&quot;  He said closing his eyes and rolling on to his side facing me, his hands tucked under his pillow with a smile on his lips.  I stared at him as his breathing evened out and he fell asleep.  Fuck!  I was falling in fucking love.</p>
