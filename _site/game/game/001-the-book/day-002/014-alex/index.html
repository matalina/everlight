<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Evening</p>
<hr>
<p>Fucking hell this boy was gonna run me dry.  And I loved it.  He was so fucking hot.   We ate our ramen when it came and he sipped at his water.  We chatted about music.  He loved dance music and gay boys, 80s glam and rock ballads.  His playlists were littered with classical and ballet, even jazz and the roaring 20s.  This boy loved dancing to everything it seemed.  He moved like a dancer.  And he was a trained killer too.  Fucking damn.  I couldn't wait to get him in bed.</p>
<p>He ordered a cup of coffee and no desert while I drank my own coffee with a simple desert.  Nox watched as I ate, and he talked about a crepe with a berry compote.  I interrupted him. &quot;You are telling me you can make this crepe with berry compote?&quot;</p>
<p>He grinned. &quot;I can.  And I can make a better ramen than this.  And probably a steak better than the best joint in town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds like a lot of bragging for a Venatori hunter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had a lot of time on my hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll have to prove that.  Breakfast?&quot;</p>
<p>Nox smiled. &quot;Now who's teasing.&quot;</p>
<p>I stood up and dropped money on the table that covered the bill and the check and he shook his head. &quot;I can help you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next time, pretty boy.  And I'm not teasing you.  Straight up stating a fact.  You are going to take me out for a drink.  We are going to scout out your little club for the night.  And then I'm going to take you home.&quot;  I grabbed his arm and he stood up and I whispered into his ear. &quot;I'm going to fuck you in the living room before we get to the bedroom.  We'll grab a shower, hit the bed and then in the morning, you are going to make me some fucking crepes and berry compote.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;  He said breathlessly.  His entire body shuttered with pleasure and relief.</p>

<hr>
<p>We walked to Frozen.  It was no farther than walking to my car the other night, but somehow it felt shorter.  I suppose having a pretty boy next to me who I wanted more than anything I'd wanted in a very long time didn't help the flux of time.  It also felt way too long before I could get him home and carry out my plans.</p>
<p>Nox tensed as we walked past a man.  I saw the crossed swords tattoo just a moment before Nox dodged out of the way of the man's sword.  A fucking sword, where the fuck did that come from.</p>
<p>In his movement, Nox did something and it whistled past the Venatori who attacked.  The night sky light up like someone shown a spot light on us.  What the fuck.</p>
<p>I tried to steal a vulnerability but everything was happening too fast and it slipped through my fingers.</p>
<p>There was a loud pop and Nox shouted. &quot;Fuck!&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>The Venatori swings again at Nox and the blade slices across his arm and chest and blood begins to ooze from the wound.  But it doesn't hinder Nox as he reaches out and grabs my shoulder and a warm tingling sensation envelopes my body.</p>
<p>A fog begins to roll in from nowhere and before my vision is obscured I try to grab another dream but his mind is slippery and I'm unable to grasp anything at all.</p>
<p>In the fog, a pair of red eyes pierces the fog.  What the fuck!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong></p>
<p>Venatori runs away with impaired vision.</p>
<p>Recovery Rolls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nox : 1d6+1: [5]+1 = 6<br>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nox grabbed my hand and we stood back to back waiting for an attack that never came.  &quot;Who the fuck was that?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Nox shrugged. &quot;I don't know.  Venatori.  I was informed that there was probably an unofficial kill order out on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? What the fuck did you do?&quot;  I turned to look at him and only saw the peircing red eyes of an animal peering through the fog.  &quot;Let's get out of here, this fog is creepy.  Fucking eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>Nox laughed. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait that's all your fucked up magic?&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Yep.&quot;  He took my hand and we walked a few steps out of the fog in the direction of Frozen and the fog was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck!&quot;  A cold chill wrapped around my body, and the puddle in the street gutter froze. I looked at Nox, he looked better.  I swore he was bleeding much more than that.</p>
<p>&quot;You okay? I thought...&quot;</p>
<p>Nox nodded. &quot;A minor wound.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Healing magic, sorta.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That freezes water.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Magic.&quot;  He said. &quot;One of the side effects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;  I said like I understood. &quot;Still up for some recon?&quot;</p>
<p>Nox nodded. &quot;Yeah.  You?&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.  &quot;Yeah.  I think I need that drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry you got brought into that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just glad you are okay.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>He grinned. &quot;I'll be fine.&quot;</p>
