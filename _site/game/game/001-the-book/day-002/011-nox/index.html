<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Evening</p>

<p>[!note]<br>
Nox goes to the Archives looking up runes</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Nox find anything about runs in the Archives?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [18]+0 = 18)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything on the book?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [13]+0 = 13)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does he know what it does?</em><br>

<strong>No, and</strong> Decomposed, Rope, Awful</p>

<p>After calling Alex I took a walk to the Archives.  Only a few places still were maintained, and the place with all the books was one of them, despite it being empty.  There wasn't even a librarian in the place.  I had to use the card catalog in the archaic ways of the old world to find the books I was looking for.</p>
<p>There wasn't a lot in the Archives.  A few remnants of historicals on runes and the covens in the area.  The Althalar coven was an offshoot of the Dioscuri Oneiroi who came to the New World and became Circuls Elysii or more notable The Circle of Elysium. According to the records the Elysium district was one home to one of their power circles, which has now become the Althalar Amphitheatre home to some rather famous rock and punk bands like Phantom Rage, Cursed Chains and Infernal Echoes.  People regularly sit in the stands and busk and do other creative endeavors, the place is said to radiate muse vibes.</p>
<p>The only thing I found out about the book Vlad/Michael had seen is that it went by the name, the Book of Origins.  It's rumored to be a guide to how the universe began -- hence the name.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anything happen to Nox between the archives and the evening?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [18]+0 = 18)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Something important?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [13]+0 = 13)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does it have to do with Jace?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [16]+0 = 16)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does someone come after him?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [6]+0 = 6)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> threaten him?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [5]+0 = 5)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>

Alex sees Jace hitting on Nox but it's not Nox</p>

<hr>
<p>It was all sorta heavy stuff, and by the time my alarm went off to remind me I had a club to get ready for my mind was full of churning chaos.  I needed time to meditate and cool the magic down.</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditates an hour and replaces all cyphers</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn't grab anything to eat after my yoga routine, but I needed a shower and I wanted to look and smell my best for Alex.  I spent too much time getting ready.  It was nearing 7pm and I was still looking through my bag trying on clothes.  Not that I had a lot but there were either too many holes in the jeans, or I felt they were too tight for a recon mission where I might need to move around a lot to do what needed doing.</p>
<p>And the shirts.  I wished to the high fucking heavens I could get past my fucking issues with what shirt came next.  Pants were different.  I don't know why, don't know why my brain said jeans were jeans and the order didn't matter, but fucking shirts!</p>
<p>I growled as I pulled on the next t-shirt in the line up over a pair of tight black jeans with only one ripped out knee.  It looked stylish at least even with the shreds of thread hanging down.  I pulled on a black mesh shirt over the Walking Toys t-shirt that depicted Woody and gang as zombies.</p>
<p>Aggravated with the sleeves, I took both off and ripped the sleeves from the t-shirt leaving it look more walking dead than it had before.  Tossed a few more slashes through the garment and made a very club going fare underneath the black mesh t-shirt.  Some skin, but not too much.  It all went very well together.  I was more impressed with my outfit than I aught to be.</p>
<p>I stood in front of the bathroom mirror fixing my makeup.  The eyeliner was perfect, my hair could use a recoloring but I didn't have time to do that, the red was fading into an ugly color so I spruced it up with some colored wax to keep it all from moving.  Was shitty for making out but I'd survive that if I had to.  Hopefully Alex wasn't a fingers through the hair type guy.</p>
<p>I grabbed a couple condoms and stuck them in my back pocket, applied a fresh coat of strawberry lip gloss and popped the stick in my front pocket with a a few travel packets of lube. Third date -- right?  I grinned at myself in the mirror and hoped I wasn't presuming too much on this.  I wanted to see Alex -- but not just because I thought we'd have sex.  I kinda just wanted to see him.</p>
<p>I heard a faint noise in the hall.  But the rune tended to muffle sounds of nearby places it was hard to make out.  I had a strange feeling, it wasn't the feeling of magic about to burst.  More like two lines crossing or someone walking over my graved.  I shuddered with the sensation.</p>
<p>I opened the door and looked down the hall.  To my left Jace had a man pressed up against the wall.  It only took me a moment to realize what was happening when the man pulled his right fist back and popped Jace in the face.</p>
<p>And to my right stood Alex.  He was staring at the two men down the hall and then he looked at me.  &quot;You have a fucking twin?&quot;</p>
<p>I smirked. &quot;My brother, Rider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He called him Damien.&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you lied to me about your name?&quot;</p>
<p>Rider took that moment to wrap his arms from behind around my waist and lift me up in a giant bear hug. &quot;Jesus, Nox, you have all kinds of guys hitting on you don't you.  Don't they know I'm the better looking one.&quot;  He said then set me down and pressed a kiss to my cheek.  &quot;You look good.  Going out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was.&quot;  I looked at Alex who was staring at the two of us.</p>
<p>Jace came over with his hand to his nose. &quot;You broke my nose, bastard!&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at both of us and did a double take.  &quot;What the fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Touch my brother again when he says fucking No and I'll do more than that you fucking asshat.&quot;  Rider said getting in Jace's face.</p>
<p>Jace turned to Alex and looked at me.  &quot;You gonna let your fuck twad boyfriend talk to me like that Xander.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait.&quot; I growled.  &quot;Xander.&quot;  I looked at Jace then back to Alex. &quot;Xander Gerard.&quot; I laughed. &quot;I'm not the only one who didn't say the whole fucking truth.  Do you want to talk?  Or do we want to go out as planned, we can talk while we eat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm only going out with one of you.&quot; Alex jabbed.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be him.&quot; Rider grinned. &quot;I don't fuck guys, and I sure as hell do not get fucked by them.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex grinned. &quot;Got it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can crash in my room.  Or go out.  Obviously no one noticed you weren't me.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex chuckled. &quot;You don't even have the same color eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one ever notices that.&quot; We both said at the same time with a grin.  &quot;I'll see you later?&quot; I asked Rider.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be here.&quot;</p>
<p>Rider's comment made me remember my promise.  I stepped back inside and grabbed the ear cuffs with a bell on each end and pushed both on grinning at Alex.  &quot;With bells on.&quot;</p>
