  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Evening</p>
<hr>
<p>Another fucking shirt ruined.  The t-shirt would be just fine add to the aesthetic, but that was twice in twenty-four hours I ruined a decent shirt because someone stabbed me.  Fucking bullshit.</p>
<p>Alex's concern for me was heart warming, and his hand in mine as we walked the street towards Frozen.  We passed the parking garage, and turned a corner to walk down another busy street where the line of the night club wrapped around the corner.</p>
<p>The music pumped through the door as people flowed inside.  I wondered what capacity was.</p>
<p>Alex asked as we walked past the bouncer, &quot;You sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were lucky I didn't explode before, let's not press our luck.&quot; I grinned at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wasn't so bad.&quot; Alex grinned and we found the end of the line and stood there awkwardly.  People continued to line up after us.</p>
<p>Some of the music flittered past the line and out the door.  But it wasn't quite loud enough, and it was sadly disappointing.  I caught snippets of a song we had danced to the night before -- one of my current faves.</p>
<p>Disappointed I might not get a chance to dance to it with Alex again I pulled out my phone and made sure I had a good signal as I hadn't downloaded my playlists yet and found the song.  I handed Alex an ear bud and we stood close together.  He slipped the earbud in his ear and I did mine.</p>
<p>When I hit play he's smile broadened.  I put my arms around his neck and moved against him.  He pressed his face into my neck as he pushed me forward when the lined moved.  &quot;You are a fucking tease.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like this song.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I know.  You teased me with it last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm teasing you with it again tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That the kinda club you wanna go to tonight?&quot; Alex whispered as I sorta danced in place.  Alex didn't seem to mind from the reaction I could feel.</p>
<p>&quot;You seen the video?&quot; I stepped back and asked while making sure I caught the look on his face as he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;What kinda pansexual freak would I be if I didn't?&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned and stepped back into him and finished dancing to the song. &quot;I only need the song.  Just you and me anywhere you want.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex growled. &quot;I'm not sure where that fits into my plans, but it is definitely part of it now.&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled.  &quot;How about between the shower and the bed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that order?&quot; Alex asked.</p>
<p>I nodded, &quot;When you get tired of watching me you can tuck me in and ravish me.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex laughed. &quot;I don't know if I'll be able to keep up pretty boy.  I'm not slouch, but...&quot;  He took a step back pulling the ear bud from his ear and handing it back while gesturing to my body.</p>
<p>I bit my bottom lip and closed the distance pulling him against me and pressing my face to his neck to take a long draw of breath against him before I whispered in his ear. &quot;Oh, Alex, baby, I'm just teasing you, I'm fairly sure I'll blow the moment I let go. And I do not have <em>that</em> much stamina. It's been a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With a guy?&quot; Alex asked.</p>
<p>&quot;With anyone.&quot; I confessed.  &quot;After graduation, choices are limited when you are a pariah.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything happen before getting to the door?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [16]+0 = 16)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I was more than happy curled up against Alex while we waited.  The awkward silence of before was no longer there, his fingers traced a line of skin just above the waist of my jeans and I kissed his neck.  It was perfect and it felt like home.  Felt like nothing I'd felt before.  Safe...</p>
<p>Alex guided us forward a couple of steps when a young thug yelled, &quot;Move it Fatty.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked behind us to see a curvy girl on her phone holding up the line.  She'd obviously not been paying attention.  Her eyes were already sad before the thug had yelled at her.  She looked like she was waiting for her friends, or worse yet, they were asshats who told her to meet them to go out.  Fuckers!</p>
<p>Didn't matter her story she was near tears.  I pulled away from Alex, &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyebrow went up as I headed to the back of the line to this girl.  &quot;Hey Duckling, there you are.  We are up here.&quot; I shouted.</p>
<p>She looked at me bewildered.  The guy laughed, &quot;You with this fatty?&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled and wrapped my arm around her shoulders and pressed a kiss to her lips.  She tasted like tears and peppermint.</p>
<p>I turned to the thug, &quot;You got something you wanna say to me?&quot; I said then turned towards Alex and pointed. He waved, &quot;We are up there, why don't you join us.&quot;</p>
<p>She scurried off as the young thug stepped up to me. &quot;You were just street fucking your friend.  You want me to believe you aren't a fag? I'll break that pretty face.&quot;</p>
<p>He wound up for a punch.</p>

<p>Predictable.  I dodged out of the way and used his momentum to catch his arm and crane it behind his back and lift him just off the ground so it was painful.  &quot;Why don't you find yourself at the back of the line?  Or better yet, away from here you fucking little shit.&quot;</p>
<p>I let him go with a shove away from the line and waved the other's past us.  He came at me again, this time with a headlong rush.</p>

<p>He caught me before I could move and we crashed into the wall behind us scattering the line.  I felt Alex more than saw him move towards us and I held up a hand as the thug tried for sucker punch to my gut.</p>

<p>But he countered and we stayed locked with our hands tied.  He tried to attack me but I held him at bay with ease.  I wasn't strong, but I was stronger than this ass hat.  He was just tiring himself out.</p>
<p>I could feel the strength leaving his body -- or his will to fight.  &quot;You done yet?&quot;</p>
<p>I pushed him away from me one more time.</p>
<p>He dusted himself off like he'd fallen to the ground and gotten dirty or something.  &quot;Faggot!&quot; he yelled as he walked down the street away from the line.</p>
<p>&quot;Asshole.&quot; I said as I returned to Alex and the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't have to do that.&quot;  She said.</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot;  I offered my hand.  &quot;Nox.  This is Alex.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We met already. Stella.&quot;</p>
<p>I took her hand and pressed it to my lips and gave her a flamboyant bow with the wave of a top hat I was not wearing. &quot;A pleasure.&quot;  I grinned and winked at her. &quot;You are free to go ahead of us.  Though I hope your friends show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they are.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed. &quot;I was afraid of that. This isn't a place you want to be alone in.  And I can't guarantee I'll be paying that much attention when we get inside.  Club is loud, and dark, and I'm a bit handsy and a lot horny, and no offense but girls don't do it for me.&quot;</p>
<p>She blushed. &quot;That kiss.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;Was hot, yes. I'm pretty good at faking arousal with girls until they get me going.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex interrupted. &quot;Don't mind him.  He was raised by wolves. He doesn't know how to talk to girls.  Or anyone for that matter without turning it into a sexual innuendo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon.  You were giving as good as you were getting, Mr. Control Freak.&quot; I said with a look that told Alex I did not mind his commanding attitude.  And he knew it too from the smirk I got back, and the twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>I sighed. &quot;We won't be the best company, but if you have your heart set on going in, we'll keep you safe.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex sighed.</p>
<p>Stella laughed.  &quot;No.  I think I'll go home.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked relieved.  Stella left us her number which I felt bad for trashing as soon as she left. &quot;You're one of those.&quot;  Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a love'm and leave'm, yes.&quot; I said and gave Alex a serious look, &quot;But not tonight.&quot;</p>
