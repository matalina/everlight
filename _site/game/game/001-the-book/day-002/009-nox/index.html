  <p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday Morning</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a spare room?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [19]+0 = 19)<br>
<strong>Yes, and</strong> Sarcophagus, Effect, Witness</p>
<hr>
<p>Getting back to my room wasn't difficult.  Jace had tossed all my things out the door into the hall.  Sorta figured.  I grabbed my bag with my pillow and headed down to the main office, the dorms always had someone on duty.</p>
<p>I knocked, and a small woman with thick glasses and freckles looked up at me.  &quot;You already make trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes ma'am.  I stepped between my roommate and an innocent vampire who was just asking Jace to leave to club, and to leave his friend alone.  They had to man handle him to make him leave. I'll take a fucking closet at this point.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>She grinned at me. &quot;That can be arranged.  Ain't that what you New York City folks have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have runes on the door.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got lots of closets.  No runes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can show you.&quot; I said. &quot;Though without the right magic it might not work.  Wasn't exactly allowed to practice Sussuri runes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would you want to?&quot; she laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Good to know.&quot; I said.  &quot;But seriously I don't need a lot of space.  I'll take a couch to crash on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a room.  Most people think it's a closet so they don't much like it.  No kitchen, shared bathroom, no windows.  It was a closet but we have no use for it and a twin bed fits, so we rent it out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds perfect and I don't have to listen to assholes snore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know Jace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was my roommate back in school.  Fucked with me then.  Hates me now.&quot;</p>
<p>She chuckled and lead me down the hall, not far from the office and underneath the stairwell.  &quot;I think I forgot to mention that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's perfect. I don't need much.  This is all I got to my name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you should try that rune.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Magical Repertoire rewrites Cyphers</p>
<p>Recovery: 1d6+1: [3]+1 = 4</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Draw the run correctly? (9)</em><br>
(1d20: [19] = 19)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
<strong>Minor effect or Damage +3</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>And...</strong><br>
Turgid, Downward, Express<br>
(1d20: [2] = 2)</p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura</em>: (1d20: [2] = 2) -&gt; all actions are hindered for one minute</p>
<hr>
<p>I pulled my pencils out of my bag and picked one with a duller lead so it would be a thicker line and take less time to draw.  I remembered what it looked like.  Or at least I think I did.</p>
<p>It wasn't a hard one to draw.  I joked that it was the tardis run, and funny thing was it sorta looked like a tardis -- at least Dr. Who's tardis.</p>
<p>There was a shift in magic when I finished the rune and I felt a little less coordinated and was grateful that was all it did.  And it only affected me.  No harm to anyone else.  I don't know if that meant it worked or if failed.  I opened the door to find a slight bigger room than a closet I expected.  And there was a small kitchen and a bathroom.</p>
<p>The woman whistled.  &quot;Now that is handy. It's got everything you need.  A bed, the kitchen, even a washer and dryer, look at that.  But why not something bigger?&quot;</p>
<p>I shrugged. &quot;I'm good with the size.&quot;</p>
<p>I stpeed through the door and felt the slight tingle of magic and hoped that was the extent of my magical changes.  Though I expected that I'd pop again when the nepenth ended during my sleep.  I should prepare for the eventuality.</p>
<p>She nodded her head. &quot;I am Emily.  Emily Ballard.&quot;</p>
<p>I offered her my hand and she took it softly in hers.  &quot;Nox.&quot; I said, pulling her hand to my lips and bending over in a flamboyant bow and wave of my invisible hat. &quot;A pleasure, mad'am.&quot;</p>
<p>Emily laughed.  &quot;I know <em>who</em> you are.  And I know better than to fall for you.&quot;  But she didn't correct me of my own name like most fucking Venatori.</p>
<p>I leaned in and whispered. &quot;I like boys.&quot; I grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew that too. Bowers wants to see you in the morning.  Probably regarding your interference.  We don't have as many rules as New York City hunters, but getting in the way of his kill, that's gonna take a hit against some of the people around here.&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled at her. &quot;I think that's why they sent me here.  So someone will kill me.  Goodnight, Emily.  I have a boy to text.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you texting him&gt;&quot;</p>
<p>I snickered.  &quot;A tease.&quot; I closed my door with a wave and set my things down on the floor.  I'd grab a shower and then send Alex a text.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spelpt with dreams of a hot blue-eyed boy dancing in my dreams.  I woke wondering where he might take me on Wednesday.  It was Saturday.  I wasn't sure if I'd here still.  But at least I'd have something to look forward too.</p>
<p>My morning was started the same way I always started it.  Yoga, a run.  A run that took me round the deserted and run down compound.  I was used to running in the city dodging people and cars that this was simple and I ran faster and further than usual before I grew tired and was back inside for a shower and breakfast.  Breakfast in the dorm cafeteria because I hadn't had time to go grocery shopping.  Needless to say I was going to be paying for my breakfast later.</p>
<p>I had a meeting with John Bowers at 9am in the Armory.  There weren't many buildings in repair.  Only the important ones.  most of them had broken windows and looked like the apocolypse had struck early.  I half expected the walking dead characters to show up and save me from a walker.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Bowers want to see Nox because of Jace?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [11]+0 = 11)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Door, Disciple, Question<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] GM Intrusion<br>
Order Nox to retreive the book rumored to be in Johnny Rose's possession</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I knocked on the door jamb of the open door.  A man with a gruff exterior sat at a desk looking down with glasses perched on his nose going over a book. His finger drawing across the lines in the book he was reading.</p>
<p>&quot;Damien.&quot;  He waved me inside. &quot;Normally, I'd have you in front of a firing squad for interfering in a kill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But?&quot; I said trying my best not to growl.</p>
<p>&quot;But.&quot;  He looked up and turned the book around so I could read a passage he was pointing at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've seen the book with my own eyes.  It lies in a safe shrouded by darkness in the strangest of locations -- the night club Frozen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;What's this?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a journal from a hunter from about 30 years ago. He went after Einor and the Masquerade, didn't come back.  Only thing they found was this journal.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Nox recalls hearing the story from a remember spell and his knowledge of the occult.</p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura</em>: 1d20: [8] = 8 -&gt; Creepy Dissonant Whispers emanate from everywhere</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;You only found the journal because he was turned into a vampire.  Vlad Bazorov is a vampire who hunts Venatori as ruthlessly as he once hunted vampires.  He was once called Michael Snell.&quot; I said as creepy whisperes echoed in the room.  It added to the effect of the lore and I chuckled.  Sometimes the magic had a sense of humor.</p>
<p>John Bowers looked around and shivered.  &quot;You know a lot about vampires.  You a sympathizer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we should kill them just because they are vampires.  If that's what you are asking.&quot;</p>
<p>Bowers sighed and shook his head.  &quot;I unfortunately need that knowledge, your uncanny knack to make friends in places you shouldn't and I'm told that you were in the company of Johnny Rose last evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to kill him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need you to get something from his safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The book mentioned in the journal.&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Very astute.&quot;  He gave me the look that said he wasn't happy about it. &quot;Getting the book, is the only thing that preserves your life.  I was given the authority to take any action should you pose a problem or get in the way of some mission or another.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so I get the book or I die.&quot;  I sighed. &quot;I got it.  Can I go now?&quot;</p>
<p>He waved his hand. &quot;And Jace is gunning for your head.  I'd expect the others will be as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So no different than home.  Don't worry about me.&quot; I said and walked out of the room.</p>
