<p>The music was loud on the dimly lit dance floor of the nightclub I had been dragged to by my current roommate. I'd been in town for nearly an hour when I was shown to the shared occupancy room in the dormitory of the Everlight Headquarters. My reputation preceded me and most of the higher echelon sneered and turned their nose up at me.  It wasn't anything I wasn't used to, but whatever.  My roommate on the other hand was all too happy to have a friend.  He was one of those guys who floated from city to city looking for a fight and just before they'd ship him off to another city he'd leave all on his own.  And I had the goddamned pleasure of rooming with him -- again.</p>
<p>My roommate turned to be my former Academy roommate who tormented and tortured me my entire teenage life.  And now I had to live with his ass again.  But what greeted me was a friendly smile and a long dramatic 'you look good' gaze before he dragged me out to get laid.</p>
<p>Jace handed me a beer and leaned against the bar we stood at and gazed out over the thick crowd on the dancefloor.  He looked me up and down with a grin on his face.  He reached up and tousled the crimson red tips in my hair and tugged at the string of my gray hoodie.  &quot;You could have dressed up a little.  You won't get laid looking like this, Damien.&quot; I growled.  Fucking hated that name, and that's why he said it.</p>
<p>The smirk turned seductive as he leaned in and whispered. &quot;But maybe I'll fuck you.&quot;  He squeezed my arm and ran his fingers down my chest towards my belt buckle before he pressed a chaste kiss to my cheek and laughed. &quot;I'm gonna go find me some,&quot; he whispered and then shifted away from me with the lithe movements of a cat.</p>
<p>While I appreciated being forgotten by my former tormentor, I was tired and drained from the anxiety filled flight from New York to this god forsaken city in the South.  The heat was horrid and I was dying, or rather I would have been if the place wasn't air conditioned.  It still was hot because of all the bodies, but at least over half of the occupancy was vampire and cold to the touch.</p>
<p>I followed the line Jace took and my eyes roamed the crowd for anything of interest.  I'd already located all the exits and cameras like my training dictated.  I was well aware of the security details lining the walls and the few watching from the balcony above.  My eyes fell across couples chatting and singles mingling.  Several vampires were cozying up next to their next meal.</p>
<p>The whole place was charged with an energy that shouted sex and blood despite the clubs name Frozen, it was everything but.  The dancers on the pole were sexy and sexual.  The music imploded with the same energy.  Everything about the place shouted vampire den seeking willing blood donors.  And yet there were men in floral shirts and shorts and women wearing sun dresses looking like they were here on vacation.  Jace said it was a tourist trap and it catered to the townies as well as those on vacation.  Provocative and sexual all the hallmarks of a romantic getaway.</p>
<p>Two men near the dancefloor stood close together but they didn't look like they were a couple, their posture and placement were off and their conversation looked heated.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Perception (read lips) (12)</em><br>
(1d20: [8] = 8)<br>
<strong>Fail</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>Find 1d6 Cyphers</strong><br>
1d6: [6] = 6</p>
<hr>
<p>I was too far away to make out any of the conversation.  But I couldn't help but notice the taller of the two men with his dark inky black hair, the breath of his shoulders and the cut of his shirt.  He work tight black jeans tucked over a pair of black combat boots and I couldn't help but stare.  He was hot as fuck and my reaction was visceral.</p>
<p>His friend said something and Mr. Hottie looked in my direction with those piercing ice blue eyes and my dick hardened in my already tight jeans.  I licked my lips and looked away.  Not the first time I'd gotten caught staring at a hot straight man.</p>
