<hr>
<p>I got the guys number.  I was so happy with myself, but I was so pissed I didn't have my phone.  The music thumped around us as we climbed the glass steps to the offices above.  It was surreal the allure of the cold and the vampiric energy in the whole place was wild.  Back home you never felt this many vampires in one place, the Venatori would shut the joint down in a heart beat, killing every vamp it caught.  It seemed to be different hear.</p>
<p>The doors to the main office opened and when we stepped through it was silence.  Even with the door open the sound was muffled, like magic, yet I hadn't felt the press of magic against my skin.</p>
<p>I must have been looking around for when the vampire sat down in his office chair he chuckled. &quot;Sound proofing, no magic.  Must be strange for one such as yourself to feel so many of us in one place.  Being new and all. I hope you are smarter than your friend, killing one of us is an act of war on vampire soil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no problem with you or your kind.  Unless you killed a human it'll stay that way.&quot;</p>
<p>He chuckled again, he tried to give off the count Dracula vibe and I rolled my eyes.  &quot;Drink?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Water with lemon if you don't mind.&quot;  I smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not partake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Addictive personality, what can I say, better to refrain.&quot;  It was a partial truth, not a complete lie. I didn't drink because I didn't like how chaotic my magic got when I wasn't in full control of my senses.  It took a great deal of effort to keep it bottled up inside.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Intellect defense (12)</em><br>
(1d20: [9] = 9)<br>
<strong>Fail</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>And...</strong><br>
Communion, Resident, Gold<br>
(1d20: [2] = 2)</p>
<hr>
<p>The vampire laughs.  &quot;I can smell that lie.&quot;  He waved his hand and someone from a nearby room floated towards him. &quot;I need Jack Wyn on the phone, and a phone from the stash, latest model brand new.  Nothing cheap.&quot;  The girl skittered off with a lick of her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;You enthrall all your employees?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>He grinned. &quot;No, my assistant works for blood.  Wanna be vampires need to buy their way into the good graces of the council.  But a ghoul, they can feast on the sex and allure of our kind without such acknowledgement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's a slave to your whims.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed. &quot;Are you not a slave to your Venatori law.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not a slave to them or to anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>He took a long hard look at me.  Those cold blue eyes piercing my soul.  They were unnaturally blue -- the blue of contacts, meant to bewilder and mystify his prey.  And then he laughed and stood up.  &quot;Good.  That is what I like to hear.&quot;  He sauntered over to me and offered me his hand like a goddamned sheik of Persia or something.  Like I was going to kiss his rings.  Fuck him!</p>
<p>I took a step back and extended my arm and shook his hand good and proper.  The insult was not lost on him.  He growled softly.</p>
<p>A hand from nowhere emerged and placed it on the vampires shoulder.  He was human -- completely, with the mark of the vampire floating about his body.  Not completely human bound to a vampire through life and death.  A chevalier.  &quot;Johnny, he's just a kid.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny growled, &quot;He's a fucking Venatori in my house.  Disrespecting me.&quot;  He was on top of me before I could react.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Onslaught (mind) (eased) (9)</em><br>
(1d20: [12] = 12)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>And...</strong><br>
Surprise, Bell, Food<br>
(1d20: [4] = 4)</p>
<p><em>Chaos Aura</em>: 1d20: [16] = 16 -&gt; Nothing Happens</p>
<hr>
<p>His weight tumbled us to the ground and my magic flared releasing a single pulse into the mind of the vampire on top of me.</p>
<p>He rolled off of me clutching his head.  &quot;What the fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled away from him and jumped to my feet crouching in a ready stance.  A another bolt at the ready. &quot;I'm not like other Venatori.&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;I don't want any trouble, but I will defend myself.&quot;</p>
<p>The man from before stood in between us facing me offering me his hand.  &quot;Let's start over. My name is Zach Moreau.  I am Chevalier to Johnny Rose, the proprietor and current supplicant of your good graces.&quot;  He glanced back at Johnny.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, fine.&quot;  He waved away whoever was trying to help him.  The girl from before had bestowed upon him a box and he handed it to Zack.  &quot;Get him away from me.&quot;</p>
<p>Zack nodded. &quot;Same model, your sim card should work automatically.&quot;  He handed me the new phone and slide a card on top.  &quot;This is Jack Wyn's number, he's a technical assistant whom Johnny should not use without his sire's permission, but if you need help.  He's obligated to help you get the phone started.  I know Venatori don't issue your devices, stuck in the stone age.  Stupidest species on the planet if you ask me.&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled. &quot;I don't disagree.  Thank you.  I really don't want any trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Zack nodded. &quot;I know.  We've been having issues as of late.  Rumors abound that Johnny is in possession of something he is not.  Not sure why anyone would think that his sire would leave such an important artifact in her delinquent childe's hands.  People are such idiots.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People believe what they want to.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;You are right there.  Good luck, Nox.  I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot about you now that you are exiled to the Den of Darkness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; I said.  I wasn't sure exactly I was thanking him for, but it seemed the right thing to say as I was shown downstairs.  At least I got a new phone out of the deal -- and a boy's number.  That was a good start to a new life.</p>
