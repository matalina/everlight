<p><strong>Adventure Status:</strong>  Unstable 4 (12)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Friday Night</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is Jace being tossed because he's Venatori?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [13]+0 = 13)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Was he threatening a patron?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [7]+0 = 7)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did someone complain?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [7]+0 = 7)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did he hit on the wrong person?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [19]+0 = 19)<br>
<strong>Yes, and</strong> Duty, Question, Clue</p>
<hr>
<p>I was pretty sure the hot guy was flirting with me.  His smile was infectious and he couldn't take his eyes off my lips which only made me bite my bottom lip more.  So maybe not as straight as I originally thought.  But I didn't get a chance to look long, or figure out what exactly he was hiding because he certainly was keeping something on the DL.</p>
<p>Over his shoulder I saw Jace being hauled out of the club with one arm wrenched behind his back and he was trying to talk over his shoulder to the big vampire who was dragging him out.</p>
<p>I should have asked for his number, or said something cooler than, 'maybe I'll see you around'.  But I was a bit preoccupied with my roommate's problem at that moment. I followed them outside with the other security guard looking back at me, or maybe it was the guy following them out.  He didn't look like he was the guy Jace had hit on, maybe a friend?  But he watched everything with just a little distance behind the guards and my roommate -- like he was waiting to see what happened.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is Johnny following Jace out?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [16]+0 = 16)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>As I followed them out the side door, not even the front.  Whatever he'd done was not something for the public to be privy to.   The guy following them stepped into the alley after the guards tossed Jace through the heavy door.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Do they want to harm Jace?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [15]+0 = 15)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Did Jace hit on Zack?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [11]+0 = 11)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Nothing, Carry, Smell<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The guards standing at the door glared at me and I nodded past them.  &quot;I'm with him.&quot;</p>
<p>They took one look at me and shoved me out the door too. I guess they didn't like the look of my tattoo.  &quot;Stay out!&quot;</p>
<p>I turned with a grin and frowned, &quot;I guess I'll give giving you a shitty review on Yelp.&quot;</p>
<p>The man who had been steadily approaching Jace stopped and turned towards me with a frown of his own.  &quot;You? What?&quot; he said bewildered.</p>
<p>&quot;Ya know, the internet. It's a website that has reviews of bars and restaurants and just about everything.&quot;  I pulled out my phone and opened the app, found 'Frozen' on the list and I showed him the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Why the fuck?&quot;  The vampire said as he snatched my phone from me and glared at it like it was a foreign language.</p>
<p>&quot;Nox, don't.  I got this.&quot; Jace tried to interrupt and he pulled out a stake from the inside of his jacket.</p>
<p>The vampire's back was to him as Jace raised the stake high to strike hard through the rib cage.  I grab the vampire and move him out of the way as I step between Jace and him.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Speed defense (eased) (9)</em><br>
(1d20: [7] = 7)<br>
<strong>Fail</strong><br>
Developer: <strong>PC Enabler</strong><br>
Device, Fancy, Break<br>
(1d20: [15] = 15)</p>
<p>Nox takes 2 damage</p>
<hr>
<p>The wooden stake jabs into my right shoulder and I can feel the wheels turning in Jace's head.  &quot;What the fuck man!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't come into a vampire den and just whack a vampire because he's a fucking vampire.&quot; I shouted. &quot;What did he do?  Where's your fucking contract?&quot;</p>
<p>Jace pointed at him. &quot;He's a fucking vampire and was going to kill me if I didn't kill him first.  And all be cause I talked to his precious human blood bag.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He hit on Zack.  And Zack is tired of his shit.&quot; The vampire said tossing my phone against the ground and it crackled and snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;Awe you fucker!&quot; I complained, but the vampire was advancing on Jace and I raced between them again pressing my hands to both their chests as they tried to press in on each other.</p>
<p>The guards at the door chuckled at the display.</p>
<p>&quot;Back the fuck off.&quot; I shouted at the vampire. &quot;He won't do it again.  He won't come here again.&quot; I looked over my shoulder to Jace.  &quot;Will you?&quot;</p>
<p>His dull green eyes glared at me as he pushed me towards the vampire.  &quot;Go fuck yourself!&quot;  And he ran off down the alley and into the street full of mundane people minding their own business.</p>
<p>With Jace gone, the weight of the vampire's stare fell on me.  I just rolled my eyes as I removed my hand from his chest and walked around him to pick up my smashed phone.  &quot;Thanks for that.&quot; I said to the vampire as I held up my phone and walked past him.</p>
<p>The vampire grabbed my elbow and I turned to glare at him.  &quot;Yeah?  You want something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's your name?&quot;</p>
<p>I stopped and turned towards him.  &quot;Nox.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nox what?&quot; he asked with a smile forming on his lips, and the tips of his fangs peaking out.</p>
<p>&quot;Sétanta. Why? You know some other Nox?&quot;</p>
<p>He chuckled. &quot;Just rumors.  Your Venatori like to talk and complain while they drink. Though its usually the demon child Damien stirring up the comments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They aren't my Venatori.  And my name is Nox.&quot; I said and turned back to walk home.  I was going to have issues with my roommate I think.</p>
<p>The vampire grabbed my elbow again with a smirk. &quot;Come, Nox.  Let me buy you a drink and replace your phone. I was careless.  And you took a stake for me.  I owe you at least that.&quot;  He offered me his hand with a generous smile. &quot;My name is Johnny Rose.&quot;</p>
