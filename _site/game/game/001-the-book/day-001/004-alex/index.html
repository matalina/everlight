<hr>
<p>I watched his fine ass walk away from me.  He was trailing after the owner of the club out a side entrance.  I almost followed him out but Benji slid into the vacant spot with a wide grin.  &quot;So, he was cute. But that's Johnny Rose he's trailing after.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know who it is.&quot; I scowled. &quot;Fucking vampire.&quot;</p>
<p>Benji ordered a drink and by the time the bartender brought it over Johnny Rose was walking back in with the Pretty boy in tow.  He didn't look overly enthused and his shirt had a dark stain that hadn't been there.  He walked past the bar, his eyes meeting mine and he grinned madly.  There was a bright twinkle in those gorgeous eyes as he grabbed Johnny Rose's arm and the vampire leaned back and listened to the words he spoke into his ear.</p>
<p>And then with a lick of his fucking lips he was standing in front of me with that smile and those eyes and holding out his hand.  He leaned in and asked, &quot;Can I give you my number?&quot;</p>
<p>I smirked never taking my eyes off his lips and pulled my phone from my back pocket.  &quot;You can give me anything you want,&quot; I said meeting his eyes and unlocking my phone with my thumbprint.</p>
<p>He grinned at me and then dropped his eyes to my phone, and rapidly tapped through the contacts and added his number with ease, and then pressed 'call'.  &quot;So I have your number.  But asshat over there tossed mine, and I need a new one.&quot;  He held up the shattered glass of a now broken phone he had cradle in the pocket of his hoodie.</p>
<p>He glanced over in the direction of Johnny Rose and nodded that way when he met my eyes again. &quot;I don't think he's very patient.  Call me,&quot; he said with a shy grin, &quot;Please,&quot; he added with a little wave and was off following the fucking vampire through the club and upstairs.</p>
<p>My eyes lingered on him while he talked just beyond the glass windows that overlooked the club.</p>
<p>Benji kicked my boots and laughed. &quot;I think someone's a bit hot and bothered by a cute boy.&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. &quot;He's vampire bait,&quot; I said.  Though I don't think any Venatori would let a vampire bite them -- not on pain of death anyway.</p>
<p>Benji laughed. &quot;You know that safe is in that room right?  If he's chummy with the vamps...&quot;  Benji let the thought trail off as I glanced back up and watched that Pretty boy take a sip of from a crystal glass filled with a clear liquid and topped with a slice of lemon.  A bright smile shown on his lips as he talked with his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I dunno.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>And I watched him until Benji touched my shoulder. &quot;I'm starving.  Let's get something to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up one last time to see the Pretty boy taking another sip of his drink and nodding as the vampire spoke to him from the nearby desk.  I sighed but nodded.  &quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>We walked down the street in front of Frozen towards the corner and where Serenity was parked.  &quot;There's a good diner at the corner shopping mall.&quot; Benji said. &quot;Great breakfast food.  I'm sure they'll serve pancakes and icecream.&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled. &quot;You know the way to my heart.&quot; I pressed my hands to my chest and batted my eyelashes at my friend.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as that's all I know the way to.&quot; Benji laughed.</p>
<p>We walked through the parking lot of the corner strip mall to a small hole in the wall diner situated between a barber pole and a nail salon.  &quot;Great neighbors.&quot; I laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't knock it till you tried it.&quot; Benji smiled and opened the door stepping through with a push of the heavy door so I could follow through.  I caught the jingling door on my back foot and it eased closed behind me.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the Corner Bistro.&quot; A waitress said from the counter. &quot;Find a seat and I'll be right with you.&quot;</p>
<p>The place didn't look busy, and there was only one waitress in view.  This close to a Bar Bend they should get a lot of business.</p>
<p>Benji chuckled as we sat down opposite each other in a booth in the corner.  Benji let me face the door knowing my proclivitiy to know exactly who was around me.  &quot;They'll pick up more around closing time.  A few girls are probably chilling in the back while it's slow.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded as the waitress came by with water glasses.  &quot;I'm Shelly.  What can I get you gentlemen to drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coffee.&quot; I said.  &quot;He'll take a glass of boring old water.  And you can take my order too while you are here.&quot;</p>
<p>She grinned at me and pulled out her notepad. Benji added, &quot;We'll have a short stack of pancakes with strawberry icecream each.  And don't forget the maple syrup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.  Interesting choice.  Icecream sounds like a great topping, I'll have to try it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>We ate , and chatted and I day dreamed about when I might get a call from the Pretty Boy who was making friendly with vampires.  I pulled my phone out and looked at the last call.  He'd typed in his name... Nox.  I sent him a text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Alex<br>
Call me when you get this message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benji chuckled as I tucked my phone back in my pocket.</p>
