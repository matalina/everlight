<p>The default notification went off on my phone as I was scraping the last bits of icecream and pancake from my plate.  I glanced down at the screen to see what it was -- probably just some stupid spammy email but it wasn't.  Was a text from Nox -- <em>his</em> name was Nox, it still caught me off guard that I'd taken his number and all we did meet eyes for a few moments.  I never did this.</p>
<p>I opened the message with a shit eattin grin on my face that had Benji laughing behind his milkshake he'd ordered while he waited for me to finish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Nox<br>
Still at the club.  Buy you a drink?  Find me dancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I turned the phone so Benji could read the message and he rolled his eyes and stood up, dropping cash on the table. &quot;Go.  I'll see you tomorrow and we can finish this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is just recon.&quot;  I said.  Though we both knew it wasn't.  It was all about the hot man I'd spied.</p>
<p>I didn't sent a reply to the message as I dropped more cash on the table to finish the cost and tip and all that jazz for the service.  It was great food, Benji had been right.</p>
<hr>
<p>The club was still pumping when I arrived.  It wasn't that late, and the lie was super long. But I cheated a little.  I reached into the man's mind.</p>

<p>The bouncer was an easy read as I slipped in and found the key. I wrapped an arm around his waist and whispered into his ear the sweetest nothing that the man wanted to hear and slipped my other hand into his pocket with a hundred dollar bill left his his pocket as I rubbed at the growing cock in his pants.  Men were easy to please.</p>
<p>He was so close and I stopped, he opened the velvet rope and I stepped through with a grin on my face.  He scowled and reached in his pocket.  The bouncer didn't even look at the bill as he slapped it against my chest. &quot;I don't take bribes.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed as I left.  &quot;No just a hand job.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a calembour at the door as I shut it behind me.  Seemed everyone was ready to give the guy a hand now.  I probably wouldn't be let in again.  But nothing stopping me from doing it again.  Not much anyone can do about it.</p>
<p>Now to find the Pretty Boy.  He said he was dancing.  The music was thumping loud all around, he could be anywhere.</p>

<p>I couldn't find him in the crowd.  At least not from the edge of it.  And I walked the exterior of the floor several times before giving up and wading into the throng.</p>
<p>The bodies were hot.  The music even louder.  Sex was on display everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  The air smelled of oranges and citrus and sex.  Though I didn't see anyone actually having sex.</p>

<p>Once on the floor it wasn't hard to find him.  He had a small ring around him as those closest to him watched him move.  It was captivating.  His body moved perfectly with beat. I could never dance like that. And the way he touched himself was so fucking hot.  Beads of sweat formed on his forehead and ran down his face.</p>
<p>The song ended and I could feel the smile on my face.  The space closed around him as he noticed me and moved closer, his hand reaching out towards me.  A giant smile on his face.  God, he was beautiful. I took his hand and Nox pulled me close, his hips brushing against mine.  He was hard as fuck in his jeans there was no denying it.</p>
<p>His hand slipped to my hip and guided me with a slight pressure so we stayed in sync.  I didn't need his help but I couldn't say no to the touch. His thumb found a small slip of skin above my waist band and it was electric.  The pad of his finger was so warm.</p>
<p>I put my arms around his neck and he curled around me pressing our bodies together with the closeness.  His knee pressed between my legs and the there was no possible way we could get closer fully clothed in a public place.</p>
<p>Like everyone else on the dance floor it was all sex but no fucking sex at all.  My heart raced and not just because he was hot.  It was a workout, song after song we swept across the dance floor. Swooping and swaying.  Grinding against each other.  He moved around me.  Front to front, front to back, his ass against my dick grinding.  I didn't move nearly as much as he did and he loved dancing around me and touching me.  His fingers touched my sides, he wanted more. I wanted more but it was like he was teasing us both with the desire for more.</p>
<p>Blood pulsed in my ears more than the music.  His brown eyes were alight with fire and I swear there was snaps of electricity and sparks of fire lighting from his skin when we touched.  Or he touched me.</p>
<p>My mouth was going dry for many many reasons. I didn't need to lean in but I pressed my face against his ear anyway and shouted though he could probably have heard a whisper. &quot;You said a drink?&quot;</p>
<p>He chuckled and let me go and waded through the crowd with me in tow by the hand.  I watched his ass move and he seemed to sense it as he sashayed across the floor to the music.  On the stairs leading towards the bar I yanked him the other direction.  &quot;Not here.&quot;</p>
<p>I was feeling way too good for this to be natural.  It was already starting to wear off the further from the dance floor I got.  Anger started to boil.</p>
