        <h1>Species</h1>
<h2>Player Species</h2>
<h3>Venatori</h3>
<p>A race of supernatural beings that believe they were created to patrol the supernatural.  They look human, and can breed with humans but their DNA is different and they have a single blood type.  Human/Venatori offspring are called Minorem and are typically frowned upon.</p>
<p>Venatori are trained to kill supernatural creatures.  When a human is exposed to the supernatural via an attack it is often required to take the human in.  A human can be Venatori trained and not be Venatori by species.</p>
<h4>Subspecies: Minorem</h4>
<p>Minorem are half human, half Venatori and they have potentially lesser abilities than most Venatori.  Minorem can take on the traits of their human or Venatori ancestry in an interesting mix.</p>
<h3>Sussuri</h3>
<p>Humans with innate magic have had many names through the ages, witch, wizard, mage, warlock, but they are all just slurs for the name hidden among the people -- Sussuri.  They speak with the umbra in ways others do not understand and can wield its power through dreams, runes or alchemical processes.</p>
<h3>Vampires</h3>
<p>Vampires most of the time were once human, some are born vampire, though they are a dying breed.  Vampires who were born can typically walk in the daylight but yet still require the blood of humans to maintain their power and continue to do so.  Vampires are super strong and fast and have regenerative abilities and can bend the will of the shadows to themselves.</p>
<p>The First vampires were born into the world like humans but with the inability to walk in the sunlight and the hunger for human blood.  It wasn't until later that vampires began to embrace humans as their own.  There are very few vampires who can trace their lineage back to a born vampire line.</p>

<h3>Therian</h3>
<p>Therians like the Sussuri have been called many things through the ages -- werewolf is by far the most common.  Most days therian live as human, but three nights a month they transform into their primal beasts and hunt in the darkness.</p>
<p>Therian are strong and fast and have regenerative abilities and some can even shift form at will, or cause others to shift.</p>
<h3>Humans</h3>
<p>The predominant species who typically are unaware of the occult.</p>
<h2>Non-Player Species</h2>
<h3>Marionettes</h3>
<p>Marionettes are human's possessed by an otherworldly being.  They are the predominate threat the Venatori hunt in order to keep the world safe.  Marionettes are not all bad, some ask permission and live a symbiotic relationship with their hosts, these beings typically are called 'angels'.  Those that take possession of a host without permission are referred to as 'demons'.  A third kind is a form human soul that possesses another to finish that which keeps them on earth, these are your typical 'ghost' possessions.</p>
<p>Marionettes are faster than normal and cannot be harmed only banished from the host with the host's death or other means of banishment most Venatori do not employ other methods.</p>
<h3>Possible Additional Species</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elves</li>
<li>Dwarves</li>
<li>Dragons</li>
