<h3>The Codex Arcanum</h3>
<p><em>Artifact</em></p>
<p>A mysterious book that is rumored to have extraordinary power. It contains the origin of species, spells and curses of devastating nature as well as those of  powerful creation.  It contains all known runes and those that have been long forgotten.  Only a special few can read the book.  It has a personality of its own and is temperamental.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong>  10</p>
<p><strong>Form:</strong> A large leather tome.  The pages are made from the skin of supernatural creatures and the ink is the same magical ink used in making runes.</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> It eases by three steps any task related to occult lore for anyone who can read it.</p>
<p>Only someone versed in reading runes can read the book and cast spells from the book with a successful intellect task.  See the <a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#fantastic-cypher-table">Fantastic Cypher Table</a> for spells.</p>
<p>The Book of Origins is semi-sentient and can hide the text from view from anyone it doesn't wish to read it. The book has a strange sense of humor and typically has the translator running in circles or insults the reader. (To read requires Chaos Aura, runic knowledge, to cast spells requires the Rune Caster ability)</p>
<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> The book is technically indestructible; anything strong enough to destroy an object of its level merely destroys one of its pages, and the book can't be destroyed as long as at least one page remains.</p>
<p><em>GM Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is currently kept in a safe in a club owned by the childe of Il Cane hidden by a cloak of shadow.</li>
<li>Elements taken from the DARKEST BOOK(<a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#superhero-artifact-darkest-book">https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#superhero-artifact-darkest-book</a> (CTS, 158)</li>

<p><strong>Level</strong>: 1d6</p>
<p><strong>Form:</strong> Nepenthe is created from the blood of supernatural beings and consumed in one of several ways see the table below.  The process of making nepenthe is known to very few.</p>

<h3>Vampiric Snare</h3>
<p><em>Artifact</em></p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Form:</strong> A sleek, obsidian amulet with a blood-red gemstone at its center. The gemstone pulses with an eerie glow, casting dancing shadows around the amulet.</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The Vampiric Snare is a powerful artifact designed to ensnare vampires and restrict their abilities. When activated, the amulet emits a low hum, and the gemstone glows brighter. The amulet can be used in two distinct ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vampiric Ward: By holding the amulet and speaking the command word, the user creates an invisible, dome-shaped ward with a 30-foot radius. Vampires attempting to cross the ward must make a Might defense roll with a difficulty of 6 or be repelled, unable to pass through for the duration of the ward (up to 10 minutes). Additionally, vampires within the ward suffer a reduction in their supernatural abilities, such as strength and speed, effectively lowering their level by 3 for the duration.</li>
<li>Vampiric Bind: By focusing their will and spending 1 Intellect point, the user can activate the Vampiric Snare's second power. A ghostly chain extends from the amulet, wrapping around a single vampire within 100 feet. The vampire must make a Might defense roll with a difficulty of 6 or become immobilized and unable to use their supernatural abilities for one minute. The chain dissipates if the vampire leaves the 100-foot range or if they break free with a successful Might roll against the same difficulty.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> 1 on a 1d6</p>
