        <h1>Relationships</h1>
<h2>Sex</h2>
<p>Sex is a normal part of every world, but with the supernatural there are some caveats that are explained below.</p>
<h3>Vampires</h3>
<p>A male vampire may impregnate a Sussuri female (but not a regular human, the connection to magic is required).  Roll a 1 on a 1d100 to see if the female becomes pregnant.</p>
<p>If a female becomes pregnant she must roll a 75+ on a 1d100 every day/session for 3d6 day/sessions to determine if the pregnancy is still viable.  If the last roll is a success the child is born a healthy vampire.</p>
<p>A female embraced vampire cannot get pregnant without chaotic magic and a special ritual which is never done.  There is only one known case of this happening.</p>
<h3>Therians</h3>
<p>Therians typically only have sex with their own kind due to the probability that they will communicate the disease to another individual.  However, many have sex with humans.</p>
<p>A male/female penetrative copulation has a 1 in 50 chance of communicating the disease to the other.  Roll a 1 or 2 on a 1d100 to see if the disease is passed.</p>
<p>A male/male penetrative copulation has a 1 in 5 chance of communicating the disease to the other. Roll a 1 or 2 on a 1d10 to see if the disease is passed.</p>
<p>There is a chance the new therian will mutate the disease and become human during the full moon.  Roll 1d100, if the roll is a 1 your disease is reversed and after the full moon has ended you will shift into your wolf form until the next full moon in which you will become human for 3 days.</p>
<p>There is a chance the new therian will not transform and just be a carrier.  Roll a 1d20, if the roll is a 19 or 20 you are just a carrier and do not use the Therian Focus, you do however keep the inability and granted abilities in this modification.</p>
<p>All children with at least 1 therian parent will be therian.</p>
<p>A human female pregnant with a therian child has a 10% of miscarrying the child.  Roll a 1 on a 1d10 for 9 sessions and the child is lost and the mother moves down the damage track if a PC or dies if the mother is an NPC.</p>
<h3>Venatori</h3>
<p>Venatori frown upon relationships outside of the Venatori.  But it does happen.</p>
<p>The rules with other species apply for children/sex with a Venatori, there are no adverse affects except that which apply from the other supernatural species including Sussuri.</p>
<p>A human male can easily impregnate a Venatori woman, there are no adverse effects.</p>
<p>A human woman has a 1 in 100 chance of being impregnated by a male Venatori. Roll a 1 on a 1d100.</p>
<p>The pregnant human woman has a 1 in 100 chance of having a viable pregnancy. Roll a 1d100 for 9 sessions, if the roll is 100 the child survives.</p>
<p>The pregnant human woman has a 1 in 20 chance of surviving the labor. Roll a 20 on a 1d20 to survive the birthing process.</p>
<p>The child has a 1 in 50 chance of surviving the birthing process.  Roll a 99 or 100 on a 1d100 for the child to survive.</p>
<h3>Sussuri</h3>
<p>Sussuri have the means of protecting themselves and their partner from both unwanted pregnancies and STDs.  Typically the rune is tattooed delicately on the inside of either hip bone but can be applied anywhere that is easily deactivated when a pregnancy is wanted.</p>
